<h2><a name="CHRONICLES_OF_THE_PAST" id="CHRONICLES_OF_THE_PAST">CHRONICLES OF THE PAST.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BY AN AMERICAN ANTIQUARY.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old town of Ipswich, in the Bay State, exhibits many rare
relics of antiquity. Purchased under the title of Agawam, in the
early settlement of the colony, and granted in the year 1632 to
twelve freeholders who made oath of their 'intention of settlement,'
it dates back its origin among the very first townships of New-England.
At that time, and for many years afterward, it was the
northern frontier of Massachusetts, and was constantly exposed to
the attacks of the tribes of Indians in its neighborhood. Though
its population was composed mostly of tillers of the soil, the buildings,
unlike all other farming towns of the commonwealth, were
erected for common safety upon a single street; and even to this
day its sturdy yeomanry live in town, though the farms they cultivate
are many of them miles distant in the country.</p>

<p>The old street is still in existence, and we venture to say that it
has not its parallel in all New-England. Antique domicils, exhibiting
the English architectural style of the seventeenth century;
sturdy block-houses, erected to defend the early settlers from the
hostile incursions of the crafty foe; barns, shops, and crazy wood-sheds,
leaning and trembling in extreme decrepitude; and chairs,
tables, bureaus, bedsteads, and pictures, all relics of a former age,
each one of which would be a gem in the cabinet of an antiquary,
daily exposed for sale in the windows of the trucksters or on the
counter of the auctioneer; are found in rich profusion through this
old street of the Pilgrims. But better than all else is the church-yard,
the original burial-place, with its green graves and gray headstones;
its turf-sward running far up the hill to the tall elms and
luxuriant evergreens that crown the summit; and its nameless hillocks,
catching the evening sunlight as it falls in long lines athwart
the green-slope, and reflecting it back upon the passer-by with
peculiar brightness! I love those old grave-stones, half sunk in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
church-yard mould; mid the rudely-carved cherubims with their
swollen cheeks and distended wings, or the more frequent emblems
of skull and cross-bones, are to my eye far more grateful and appropriate
than the modern blazonry upon heavy shafts, on tall, slim
marbles.</p>

<p>It is well worth the visit of many a long mile, to walk in that
ancient cemetery, and read the rustic epitaphs that would teach us
to live and die. There side by side,</p>

<p class="center">
'Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,'
</p>

<p class="noind">lie the old puritans, the rude forefathers of the hamlet, who fled
from the father-land in search of freedom to worship God; and
though they may have possessed grievous faults, yet who does not
venerate their unyielding firmness and holy piety? There too sleep
the early pastors of the American churches; the men of rare endowments
and ripest learning, who turned their backs upon the livings
of the old country, that they might plant the standard of the cross
in this distant wilderness. And there too rest the loved and venerated
of our own day, for whom, even now that so many long years
have fled, one feels as if it were impiety so utterly to have ceased
to weep, so seldom to remember! One there was, whose voice was
sweet to my ear in childhood; whose eyes, bedimmed into a pathetic
beauty, never restrained the glee that sparkled in the orbs of those
about her; her, who had so long heard the voice that called her,
whispering in her ear, that she could smile at its accents, and feel
those silent words to be cheerful as angel's tones.</p>

<p>In one corner of the cemetery, where a low sunken fence separates
it from a neighboring court-yard, is the grave of Richard
Shatswell, the first deacon of Ipswich church. In his first and only
place of residence until he emigrated, the city of Ipswich, England,
he was a man of considerable importance, having for several successive
years borne the honor of mayor of that town. But the
unjust laws against the dissenters hampered him: he could not
take the oaths of office; he would not make the sacrifice of principle
to personal honor or private emolument: and popular dissensions
bearing hard upon his refusal to recant his sentiments, he fled his
country, and became one of the first freeholders of Agawam. It is
remarkable, that on the very spot where the good man pitched his
tent and cleared his land; on the very farm where he sowed his
grain and raised his crops; lives and labors the only descendant in
the sixth generation who bears the name of Shatswell. He is now
an old man, and retains in his face and character strong impress of
his puritanical descent, as indeed does every thing about him the
mark of family antiquity. The house is one of those substantial
old mansions which our ancestors delighted to rear; and though now
far advanced in its second century, its stanch oak timbers, and
heavy mouldings, and massive ballustrades, bid fair to last for many
generations. Every article of furniture which the house contains
carries you far back into olden time. The andirons in the broad
fire-place, bearing the mark of 1596; the high-backed, spinster-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
chairs; the fantastic legs of the upright bureau; the ponderous
bellows and painted china; all are but epistles of the habits
of our sires. Better than all, however, are the family pictures ranged
along the walls, where our grandmothers vie in broad hoops and stiff
stomachers, with the more unassuming costume of their daughters.</p>

<p>I found there were connected, as usual, with these old paintings
many anecdotes of the past. At the time of the war of the revolution,
the lady of the manor was a descendant of Simon Bradstreet,
one of the early governors of the province, whom Mather calls the
'Nestor of New-England.' Her husband was a stanch whig, a
leader of one of the classes into which the town was divided; and
though the good lady coincided fully in his political sentiments, she
did not much like the infringement upon domestic luxuries which
many of the patriotic resolutions of the meetings contemplated. In
short, Madame Shatswell loved her cup of tea, and as a large store
had been provided for family use before the tax, she saw no harm
in using it as usual upon the table. There were in those days, as
there are now, certain busy-bodies who kindly take upon themselves
the oversight of their neighbors' affairs, and through them the news
of the treason spread over the town. A committee from the people
immediately called at the house to protest against the drinking of
tea. The good lady received their visit kindly, informed them of
the circumstances of the case, and dismissed them perfectly satisfied.
Some months passed away, and one Sabbath Madame Shatswell's
daughter, a bright-eyed, coquettish damsel, appeared at church
in a new bonnet. This was a new cause of excitement, and the
committee came again to administer reproof. The lady satisfied
them again, however; and they, finding that the hat contained no
treason to the people's cause, again departed. Two years of the
war had now passed away, and mean while the daughter, Jeanette,
had found a lover. It was the beginning of winter; the army had
just gone into winter quarters; and the young suitor was daily
expected home. Wishing to appear well in his eyes, the maiden
had spun and woven with her own hands a new linen dress, from
flax raised upon the homestead; and some old ribands, long laid
aside, having been washed and ironed to trim it withal, the damsel
appeared in it at church on the Sunday after her lover's arrival.
Here was fresh cause of alarm, and forthwith on Monday morning
came the officious committee, to remonstrate against the extravagance.
The old lady's spirit was now aroused, and she could contain
herself no longer. 'Do you come here,' was her well-remembered
reply, 'do you come here to take me to task, because my daughter
wore a gown she spun and wove with her own hands? Three
times have you interfered with my family affairs. Three times
have you come to tell me that my husband would be turned out of
his office. Now mark me! There is the door! As you came in,
so you may go out! But if you ever cross my threshold again, you
shall find that calling Hannah Bradstreet a <em>tory</em> will not make her a
<em>coward</em>!' It is needless to add that Madame Shatswell's family
affairs were thereafter left to her own guidance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>But they are all gone, mother and daughter, sire and son; and the
five generations of the old family sleep side by side in the church-yard.</p>

<p>A little farther up the hill, just under the shade of that stunted
sycamore, rises the humbler grave-stone of 'Joseph Smith, a patriot
in the revolution,' who is more familiarly remembered in town, however,
as 'Serjeant Joe.' Mr. Smith was one of those persons whose
characters are formed by the times in which they live; and as he
lived in the war of the revolution, and then mostly by stealing provisions
for his mess, the times may be said to have made him a
thief. And yet how hard a name to give to Serjeant Joe, for a
kinder heart than his never beat in any man's bosom. Indeed, his
very pilfering propensities may be said to have arisen from an excess
of sympathy for human wretchedness. For his own advantage he
would have scorned to wrong a man of a single farthing; but for
the poor or the suffering, his morals were not stern enough to resist
the temptation. Indeed, he often said that he 'couldn't help it,
when he know'd poor folks was suffering; and that they shouldn't
suffer as long as he had any hands to provide for them!' And so it
was. If the long winter had almost consumed the widow's fuel,
the serjeant's hand-sled, piled with wood, helped marvellously to
eke it out. If a sick child pined for a roasted apple, the serjeant's
capacious pockets unloaded golden stores of russets and gilliflowers.
Indeed, if poverty of any kind pinched neighbor or friend, the kind
old serjeant was ever ready with relief; so that at last he began to
be considered by both thrifty and needy as the almoner of the town's
bounty, and his peccadilloes were regarded as the eccentricities only
of a benevolent heart.</p>

<p>The serjeant's continuance in the army was for the whole duration
of the war. At the very first exhibition of American courage
which proved so fatal to the British troops in their excursion to
Lexington and Concord, Serjeant Smith showed himself a skilful
marksman. Learning from the rumor, which seemed to have spread
that night with a speed almost miraculous, the destination of the
detachment, he arose from his bed, equipped himself with cartridges
and a famous rifle he had used at Lovell's fight at Fryeburgh,
saddled his horse, and started for Lexington meeting-house. Meeting
with a variety of hindrances, and twice escaping narrowly from
some straggling parties of the red-coats, it was late when he arrived
on the ground, and the troops were already on their rapid retreat
toward Boston. Learning that the people were all abroad, lining
the fences and woods to keep up the fire upon the enemy, he started
in pursuit, and in the course of a few miles, on riding up a hill, he
found the detachment just before him. Throwing the reins upon
his horse and starting him to full speed, he rode within a close rifle
shot, and fired at one of the leading officers. The officer fell; and
the serjeant, retreating to a safe distance, loaded his rifle again, and
again rode up and fired, with equal success. He pursued the same
course a third time, when the leader of the retreating body ordered
a platoon to fire upon him. It was unavailing, however; and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
fourth, fifth, and sixth time, the old rifle had picked off its man,
while its owner retreated in safety. 'D&mdash;n the man!' exclaimed
the officer, 'give me a musket, and I'll see if he bears a charmed
life, if he comes in sight again!' It was but a moment, and again
the old white horse came over the brow of a hill. The officer fired,
but in vain; and before the smoke of his charge had cleared away,
he too had fallen before the unerring marksman, and was left behind
by his flying troops. When the day had closed, the wounded were
collected by the neighbors upon the road, and every kindness rendered
to them. The officer was not dead, and on being laid upon a
bed where his wounds could be examined, his first question, even
under the apprehension of immediate death, was, '<i>Who was that old
fellow on the white horse?</i>'</p>

<p>By his side sleeps his brother soldier, Ensign Edward Ross, whose
stories of 'flood and field' beguiled many a winter evening at the
farmer's fireside. How well I remember those tales of 'Saratogue'
with which the veteran used to surprise us, and my boyish wonder</p>

<p class="center">
'Stood a-tiptoe when the day was waned,'
</p>

<p class="noind">to hear the marvellous exploits he had himself performed at the
'taking of Burg'ine.' If you would believe him, the part he had
acted brought distinguished honor to the American standard,
wherever he chanced to have been, through the whole war; and I
doubt if an engagement or skirmish could have been named in
which he had not manfully battled for our freedom. He was none
of your timorous story-tellers, ever distrusting your faith and doubting
how far he should go; but a bold, hearty liar, plunging at once
into the very depths of your credulity. Let the turf be piled high
on the fire, the hearth be swept, the women-folks be seated on one
side of the capacious fire-place, and the host with mug in hand turn
round and say, 'Come, uncle Edward, it's dry work talking; take a
drink of our old October, and let's have a story about the revolution;'
and the old man would reel off such yarns as a veteran from
Cape Cod might have envied. Methinks I see him now, his staff
standing in the jam, and his gray eye lighting up with the fire of
youthful days, as he recounted the feats of arms, in language as
clear and copious as one of his own mountain streams. Light lie
the turf upon thy ashes, old soldier, and green grow the grass over
thy resting-place!</p>

<p>But passing over these, let us come to an enclosure that contains
the grave of a father and his twin daughters, sleeping side by side
in the church-yard. How quiet is the spot! How beautiful the
resting-place of the last of their race! The daisies grow sweetly
under the scented thorns that bend over the mounds, and the moss-rose
buds, jewelled with dew-drops on summer mornings, are faint
emblems of the loveliness of the maidens who rest beneath.</p>

<p>The father, a man high in his country's estimation, and whose
name is associated with more than one of her victories upon the
ocean, suffering from the effects of a wound received in the engagement
of the Hornet, had retired from the navy after the declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of peace, to reside on his paternal homestead, and superintend in
person the education of his daughters. He had known sorrow; for
the wife and mother had died and been buried among strangers in
a distant land while he was absent upon service; and the children,
the only descendants of his own or the maternal race, became more
than ever the objects of his fondest idolatry. They had been carefully
instructed during his absence; had grown in beauty of person
and mind to the maturity of womanhood; and were in every way
fitted to increase and bless the affection of the father. Though
years have passed away, there are many who still remember the
strong love that bound together the inmates of that retired mansion,
and the elegance which seemed to attach itself to every thing about
them.</p>

<p>To a finished education and a thorough knowledge of the world,
Captain A&mdash;&mdash; added a strong mind, which threw an influence over
every one with whom he associated. Upon his daughters, both partaking
more of the yielding disposition of the mother than of the
father's firmness, it was most manifest; and never in disposition, or
mind, or daily duty, were children more moulded to a parent's will.
With a love of nature, and a quick perception of the beautiful in
all her varieties, they would wander through the wood-lands and
pastures, collecting minerals and flowers to arrange and classify and
study under his direction. Guided too by him, they would scour
the hills for miles around, to trace out the ruined fortifications of the
early settlers, or to discover relics of the aboriginal inhabitants; and
then, seated on the grass beside him, listen to his teachings. It was
a beautiful group, that father and daughters; and whenever you
found them, at morning or evening, by hill or brook or sea-shore,
they impressed you with a loveliness that seemed too fair for earth.</p>

<p>Thus passed away the winter and summer of a single year.
Autumn came again, with its golden hues and soft sunlight days,
bringing joy and contentment to the dwellers of Oak-grove. Winter
approached, but with it came the symptoms of premature decay.
What meant that hectic flush on the cheek of the taller maiden,
and why the suppressed cough, and the shrinking and saddened
spirit? The father, keenly alive to all that affected the only objects
of his life, sought the skill of the ablest physicians, and by their
advice determined to try the benefit of a warmer climate. Preparations
were instantly made for the voyage; and scarcely a week
had elapsed before they were embarked and far away toward the
sunny South. There every thing was done which skill and the
affection of loving hearts could do, to drive away the approach of
the insidious malady. Rides, walks, parties of pleasure, games at
home and amusements abroad, every device to exhilarate the mind
and fortify the courage of the fair invalid, were tried, repeated, and
failed; and on the opening of another summer, the father, broken-hearted
and in despair, returned home to lay his loved one in the
grave.</p>

<p>That long summer! who of that family can ever forget it? The
assiduous attention of sister and parent to the dying one; the slow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
ride each morning to accustomed resort of brook or tree or hill-side;
the room filled with melody or fragrant with flowers; the declining
strength, cutting off one by one the enjoyments of the still beautiful
sufferer; the hopes, alternately encouraged or depressed, even to
the last; and sweeter, better than all, the soft tones of the sister or
the manly voice of the father, subdued and often broken, reading
page after page of God's Holy Word to the gentle listener, and in
the firmness of Christian grace bidding her</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Look to <span class="smcap">Him</span> who trod before<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The desolate paths of life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bear in meekness, as He gently bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sorrow and pain and strife:'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">and then the death-scene, too sacred to be unfolded to the eyes of
strangers, but beautiful as is ever the exit of the believer; are all
imprinted upon the hearts of those who witnessed them, never to
be effaced.</p>

<p>The spirit of Captain A&mdash;&mdash;, crushed by the heavy blow, clung
more closely to the surviving daughter, and in her increased fondness
seemed to find a support from utter wretchedness. Alas! that
support was also doomed to fail him! The assiduous attention so long
rendered to the deceased had proved too much; the same disease
had fastened upon her; and ere a twelvemonth had elapsed, she too
had sunk, quietly, gently, in the calmness of christian faith, into the
same grave. Her parting words, 'I shall not leave you long behind,
father!' seemed prophetic of the end; for a month had not gone
when he too, borne on the arms of four of his fellow-officers, was
laid beside his daughters.</p>

<p>That enclosure in the old burial-place is sacred to many hearts.
I have seen the mother sitting beside it, and have heard her, holding
the little hands of her child between her's, repeat the tale of sorrow,
until it's blue eyes filled with tears at the sad recital. I have listened
to the voice of the summer night-wind, as I hung over the rude
paling; have watched the stars looking down with their tremulous
beams upon the green graves; absorbed in the recollection of the
beauty that was laid beneath; and might have listened and watched
until they paled in the morning twilight, but for the deep, solemn
sound of the old church-clock, warning me of the hour of midnight.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">An</span> old revolutionary officer, now living in New York at the advanced age of ninety-one, in every respect a

<h2><a name="THE_INNOCENCE_OF_A_GALLEY-SLAVE" id="THE_INNOCENCE_OF_A_GALLEY-SLAVE">THE INNOCENCE OF A GALLEY-SLAVE.</a></h2>

<p class="center">CONCLUDED FROM OUR LAST.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> more than six weeks doctor Mallet had two patients instead
of one under his charge, in the house of Monsieur Gorsay. For some
days the situation of Lucia seemed more precarious than that of
the old man, to whom ungratified vengeance imparted an energy
which triumphed over the weakness of age, as well as the severity
of his wounds. While the outraged husband thus clung desperately
to life, which he would not leave unavenged, the young wife,
stricken by gloomy despair, seemed hastening to meet an untimely
and longed-for dissolution.</p>

<p>On seeing her becoming day by day more feeble and more
excited, the prey of a slow fever which after exhausting the body
threatened to seize upon the brain, and extinguish reason, the
physician regretted more than once the rude test to which he had
resorted, with the view of rendering his remedies more efficacious
by disclosing the source of the malady. By degrees, however, his
persevering efforts triumphed over a disease whose hold the youth
of Lucia rendered less tenacious. The fever abated before it had
carried its ravages into the sanctuary of the mind; as a conflagration,
after destroying many meaner buildings, has its progress stayed
at the threshold of a stately temple. The young wife gradually
recovered her strength, and preserved her mental powers. Sad
triumph of art! With loss of reason she would perhaps have lost
the sense of her misfortune.</p>

<p>Monsieur and Madame Gorsay had not seen each other since the
day of the attempted assassination. Separated from each other,
but united by one common thought, equally bitter to both, during
the long hours of their sad vigils they had emptied to the dregs the
contents of the empoisoned chalice of an ill-assorted union. Monsieur
Gorsay was first in a condition to infringe the strict rules
established by the physician. One evening, taking advantage of
the momentary absence of his attendant, he left his apartment,
and with difficulty ascended to that of Lucia. With a gesture of
command he dismissed the nurse, who, terrified by his unexpected
appearance, stood for some moments motionless at the
door. Lucia was sitting, or rather reclining, upon a sofa near the
fire-place. At sight of her husband she made no movement, spoke
not a word, but remained motionless, with eyes riveted upon him
with an expression of horror. Husband and wife gazed on each
other for some time in silence, marking with gloomy avidity the
ravages which disease and suffering had made upon both since their
separation. The old man found the young wife whom he had left
full of bloom and freshness, now wan and emaciated. Lucia perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
many new furrows on the brow of her husband; but soon
her whole attention was absorbed by the peculiar expression of his
eyes, which glowed upon her with implacable passion.</p>

<p>'It seems then that I must pay you a visit, since you do not
choose to descend,' said Monsieur Gorsay, seating himself at the
other side of the fire-place.</p>

<p>'They might have told you that I was ill myself,' replied Lucia,
in a feeble voice.</p>

<p>'And had you not been ill you would not have left me? Oh! I
doubt it not!' said the old man, with a bitter smile. 'But yes; I see
that you have been ill. You are so changed, that when I first
entered I hardly knew you. To judge from your appearance, you
must have suffered much.'</p>

<p>'Much!' said the young female, repressing a sigh.</p>

<p>'To suffer! and at your age! this seems very unjust, does it not?'
continued Monsieur Gorsay with ironical compassion; 'for <em>me</em> now,
who have lived so long, and am only fit for the grave, suffering is very
suitable. But for you, a child, a flower, to suffer! Yes indeed, I
can imagine how so strange a destiny surprises you, and makes you
murmur. It was <em>my</em> part to suffer all the pains, yours to enjoy all
the pleasures. What are a few drops of useless blood in comparison
with those bitter pearls, the traces of which I see in your eyes?
I have been a great egotist, no doubt; I ought to have shed your
tears as well as my own, so that the lustre of your beauty might
not have been dimmed; and I would have had but a sorrow the
more!'</p>

<p>The old man dropped his head upon his breast, and remained
silent for some time.</p>

<p>'You do not answer me,' continued he, steadily regarding his
wife.</p>

<p>'You have asked me nothing,' answered Lucia, with a mournful
air.</p>

<p>'You are right; my head is so weak that I cannot remember
what I have been saying the minute previous; or rather, I think I
said what was not in my thoughts. What was it I wished to ask
you? Ah! here it is!' continued he, after having appeared to tax
his memory; 'do you think yourself strong enough to bear a short
journey?'</p>

<p>'What journey?' said the wife, with secret disquietude.</p>

<p>'The journey to Bordeaux. You know it is but a short distance.'</p>

<p>'And what have we to do at Bordeaux?' replied she, in an
altered tone.</p>

<p>'We must be there at the opening of the assizes,' answered Monsieur
Gorsay, with affected sang froid. 'I received a summons a
few days since, inclosing one for you. They are going to try this
man, and it is necessary that we should give our testimony.'</p>

<p>Lucia arose, and fell at the knees of her husband, grasping convulsively
both his hands.</p>

<p>'I am guilty!' exclaimed she, in an accent to which despair gave
inexpressible poignancy; 'I have broken my vows; I have forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
my duties; I have deceived and betrayed you; I am a miserable
wretch, unworthy of forgiveness! I expect neither favor, nor
pity, nor mercy. Trample me under your feet; I will not utter a
complaint! Kill me; I will make no resistance! I ask nothing for
myself&mdash;I desire nothing.'</p>

<p>'For <em>whom</em> then do you ask any thing? and <em>what</em> do you desire?'
replied the old man, sternly.</p>

<p>'What do I desire!' exclaimed she, with redoubled energy; 'I
desire, I implore, that you will not cause another, much less guilty
than myself, to bear the punishment of my crime. I desire you to
retract a declaration more cruel than a murder&mdash;for the dagger only
deprives of life, the scaffold bears away honor likewise. If you
wish for blood, why not accuse <em>me</em>? There are women who kill
their husbands; why might I not be one of these? Denounce me;
I will avow every thing. You will be free from a crime which
ought to fill you with horror; and an innocent man will not be made
to suffer death.'</p>

<p>'All this is very heroic,' said Monsieur Gorsay, with imperturbable
raillery; 'but I have too good an opinion of our friend to believe
that <em>he</em> would be willing to save his life at the expense of yours.
It is his duty, as a devoted lover, to suffer himself to be condemned
to death without saying a word; and I am sure that he will do so.'</p>

<p>'He <em>will</em> do so, most assuredly,' repeated Lucia, gazing fiercely
at her husband; 'but will you, so near your own death, commit
murder? Do you believe in <span class="smcap">God</span>?'</p>

<p>'Was it Monsieur d'Aubian who taught you to believe in him?'
said the old man.</p>

<p>'You are right&mdash;you are right! Choose the most cruel words;
pierce my heart and avenge yourself; but let it be upon me alone.'</p>

<p>'And where would be the justice of that? By what rule should
the most guilty go unpunished? No! for you, tears!&mdash;for him,
death!'</p>

<p>'Death!'</p>

<p>'Perhaps only the galleys; we must not always look on the
darkest side of the picture.'</p>

<p>'But he is innocent.'</p>

<p>'Innocent!' repeated Monsieur Gorsay, rising, and dragging his
wife from the suppliant attitude she had assumed. 'In your estimation
it is only the murderer, who plunges a dagger in your bosom, who
is criminal. But do you think that the soul has no blood as well as
the body? It is the price of this blood of my soul that he must
pay, for he has shed it even to the last drop! Ah, Lucia! you do
not comprehend that I love you!&mdash;that upon this wide earth you
are my last, my only treasure! And you wish that I should pardon
<em>him</em>! Never! never!'</p>

<p>He repulsed with an inexorable gesture the young female, who
remained standing a few paces from him in an attitude of the
deepest sadness and dejection. At this moment Doctor Mallet
entered the room.</p>

<p>'It is a good sign when the patient begins to disobey the orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of his physician,' said he, with affected pleasantry; 'however, Monsieur
Gorsay, let me tell you that there is some imprudence in
leaving your chamber.'</p>

<p>'I must accustom myself to it, however,' replied the old man.
'In about a fortnight I shall be obliged to take a journey, for reasons
which admit of no excuse.'</p>

<p>'Ah! yes,' said the doctor, glancing furtively at Lucia, 'the trial
at Bordeaux. We shall take the journey together; for I have also
received a citation, although there is little that I can tell. Will
Madame Gorsay accompany us?'</p>

<p>'In her present situation,' replied Monsieur Gorsay, composedly,
I fear it would be imprudent, and perhaps dangerous. You, who
are her physician, will doubtless not refuse a certificate which I
can produce before the president of the assizes.'</p>

<p>'We will see about it,' said Monsieur Mallet, with an evasive smile.
'Thank God! Madame Gorsay is now completely convalescent,
and a little excursion, far from being attended with danger, would
probably be of service to her. But we will decide this matter
when the time arrives. In the meanwhile, my good patient, will
you please descend to your own apartment? Here is my arm.
Madame has been up too long to-day; she is fatigued, and must be
left to repose herself a little.'</p>

<p>Offering no remark, Monsieur Gorsay accepted the proffered arm
of the physician, and took leave of his wife with hypocritical tenderness.
The two men left the room, to which, in about half an
hour, Monsieur Mallet returned alone.</p>

<p>'Doctor, I will go to Bordeaux,' said Lucia, abruptly, who seemed
to have expected his return.</p>

<p>'I have my doubts of it, but should like to be certain,' replied
the physician, with a mournful smile.</p>

<p>'You will not give the certificate which is asked of you?' continued
she, with an air at once of command and entreaty.</p>

<p>'I cannot give it conscientiously. You are in fact sufficiently
strong to bear the fatigue of so short a journey; but it is not the
journey that I dread; it is the sojourn there.'</p>

<p>Lucia briskly approached the doctor, and laid her hand upon his
mouth. 'In the name of Heaven, not a word more!' said she;
'whatever you may have seen, heard, or suspected, (for during my
fever I doubtless have spoken,) whatever you may now know, say
nothing to me. Pity an unfortunate woman; serve me, but spare
my feelings! May I rely upon you?'</p>

<p>'As on a father,' replied Monsieur Mallet, with tenderness; and he
pressed to his lips the hand she had laid upon them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> attempt made upon the person of Monsieur Gorsay produced
through all the department of the Gironde a sensation exceeding
any thing that had been known for many years previously. The
age and wealth of the victim; the respect in which he was generally
held in the country; the strange contrast between the two individuals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
apprehended on suspicion; the one a man of the world,
connected with the best families of Guienne, and already somewhat
noted for the follies of a dissipated youth; the other a convict just
released from the galleys, as was stated on the first examination;
and lastly, the illness of Madame Gorsay, which was generally
attributed to conjugal attachment, the more meritorious, considering
the age of its object; all these circumstances, over which there still
hovered a mysterious uncertainty, had excited public curiosity to
the highest pitch. Every one was impatient to solve the bloody
enigma. The two accused individuals especially became the daily
subjects of a multitude of conjectures, of explanations, of discussions,
of wagers even, which were sustained with equal obstinacy
by each party. Some refused to give credence to the guilt of
Arthur. Of this party were in the first place all the women; who
could believe the possibility that a man worthy of their regard
might commit a poetical crime, but not that he could be guilty of a
petty offence.</p>

<p>'Shocking!' exclaimed the fashionable fair ones of Bordeaux:
'Monsieur d'Aubian, with whom we used to dance last winter, he
assassinate an old man! A young man of such polished manners!
so agreeable, so witty, and with such a true Spanish air! He
attempt to kill an old man to steal his purse! Preposterous!'</p>

<p>Had Arthur been accused of stabbing Monsieur Gorsay with
some romantic intent, to run away with his wife for instance, the
thing, however dreadful, might have had an air of probability. Sentimental
spirits would not have refused pity for a crime thus
ennobled by passion; but to stick a knife in a man for the purpose
of afterward emptying his pockets&mdash;this was the act of a galley-slave,
and not that of a gentleman. Thus reasoned female good
sense; which, as is generally the case, reasoned with tolerable
correctness.</p>

<p>On the other side, Bonnemain did not lack officious defenders.
And first, he had on his side the lower orders, naturally hostile to
the aristocracy, and who, between two suspected individuals,
naturally lean toward the one in the lowest station. Then came
the friends of humanity, philanthropists by profession, emancipators
of negroes, and all those individuals who busy themselves with the
future prospects of nations, and the progress of society; a race
abounding in compassionate souls, in whose estimation a man of
the meanest nature, provided he is guiltless of actual crime, and
especially if he has just been released from the galleys, becomes a
prodigiously estimable character. These persons did not content
themselves with treating as a frivolous, and even a barbarous prejudice,
the opinion which sought to vindicate d'Aubian, by recalling
the former suspicious circumstances of the life of his fellow-accused:
they awaited more impatiently than the others the result
of the trial, fully expecting to find in the acquittal of Bonnemain
a new text for their sermons against the prejudices which dare to
hold in legitimate suspicion those unfortunates whose moral education
the galleys have just completed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Between these two opinions a third sentiment prevailed: it was
that of those impartial men, who, to reconcile all differences, maintained
that both the accused were equally guilty, and anticipated
the verdict of the jury, by proclaiming their confederation to be
beyond a doubt. This third party, which it was whispered had
good reasons for its existence, succeeded in making the difficulty
more complicated instead of clearing it up.</p>

<p>While the crime and the approaching trial were thus the general
topic of conversation, on both sides of the Garonne, for twenty
leagues around, the investigation was pursued with the activity
which the importance of the case and the near approach of the
assizes demanded. The details of the inquiry seemed to add
weight to the opinion of those who were for acquitting the galley-slave
at the expense of the lover. To the reiterated questions put
to them, the prisoners both persisted in the system of absolute
denial behind which they had, in the first instance, entrenched
themselves; but in proportion as the new facts brought to light
during the procedure appeared favorable to Bonnemain, so much
the more overwhelming did they seem for Arthur. Except this
latter, who was unwilling to make any disclosures, no one at the
time of the attempt had seen the galley-slave. Arrested at break
of day on the road to Bordeaux, it was no difficult matter for him to
explain the cause of his early peregrination. His story was, that
suspecting his companions had discovered his real condition, he
was fearful of being denounced by them to the officers of justice,
and of being pursued for having broken his sentence of banishment.
That he might not be arrested, he had resolved to quit the
country, and had set out in the middle of the night that his departure
might not be noticed. The pieces of gold found upon him
were the fruits of economy, and the amount was not sufficient to
render this assertion improbable. Beside, no traces of blood had
been discovered upon his dress, either in consequence of his
having changed his clothes between the commission of the crime
and his arrest, or of his having, in the very perpetration of the
deed, preserved sufficient coolness to avoid all tell-tale stains. In
fact his hands, which were carefully examined, seemed clean,
without the appearance of having been recently washed; for the
adroit villain, to avoid giving a pretext for suspicions which might
have been excited by a neatness seldom practised by country
laborers, a race of men in general very guiltless of ablutions, had
with ingenious refinement worn gloves when he committed the
deed. As for the knife which was used, no one had ever seen it
in the possession of the culprit; and were it not for the circumstance
of his former condemnation, he would probably have at
once been set at liberty for want of proofs.</p>

<p>But while the innocence of Bonnemain, at each new step in the
investigation, appeared more evident, proofs more and more weighty
accumulated around Arthur; proofs sufficient to have established
his guilt, even without the damning declaration of Monsieur Gorsay.
The knife, it is true, could not be proved as belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
him; but other evidence was brought forward, not less conclusive.
The rope-ladder was identified by a rope-maker, who declared that
he had sold it to Monsieur d'Aubian some months previously. It
was evident from this fact that the entry of Arthur into the park
was not accidental but premeditated; the instruments used for
scaling walls being found in his possession. It was farther proved
that during the summer Monsieur Gorsay had received at Bordeaux
a payment of twenty thousand francs, which he had immediately
converted into gold, and that d'Aubian, who was the fellow traveller
of the old man on the occasion, had knowledge of these two facts.
On an investigation of the previous life of the accused, it appeared
that for several years past, he had lost at play large sums of money,
and had contracted debts, for the discharge of which his patrimony
seemed insufficient; and when the domiciliary visit was made to
his house, very little money was found there. From all these
circumstances, skilfully grouped, and made to throw light upon
each other by their juxtaposition, the gentlemen of the law, practised
in the subtle deductions of judicial logic, found little difficulty
in arriving at a decisive conclusion. In their eyes, Arthur d'Aubian,
ruined by play, and unable to borrow more money, had determined
to commit a robbery, which chance had nearly converted into a
murder. Indeed, it was only those who were most lenient in their
judgment, who admitted this last supposition. The Dracos of the
bar considered the premeditation of the murder, as well as of the
lesser crime, fully established.</p>

<p>Such was the situation of affairs, and the state of public opinion,
when the court at length opened at the principal city of the department.
The prisoners had been removed a few days previously
from the house of detention at Reole to the central prison of Bordeaux.
The witnesses, among whom were Monsieur Gorsay and
his wife, arrived at that city shortly afterward. At the approach of
the last scene of a drama, with which all minds had been occupied
for more than two months, public curiosity was raised to a pitch of
extreme excitement. The disclosures of the inquest had thinned
the ranks of the defenders of Arthur: the women alone generally
remained true to him; and the stronger the presumptive proofs
appeared against him, the more ardent they became in his defence.</p>

<p>'What signify all these quibbles of the law?' said the most
zealous of his fair partizans; 'he has been known to lose money at
cards; this only proves that he is not lucky at play. He has debts;
how could it be otherwise, when a young man goes into society
without a fortune? And above all, it seems he sometimes made
use of a rope-ladder. This is the grand crime! Poor young
man!'</p>

<p>The rope-ladder, indeed, had contributed to strengthen in the
hearts of many of the defenders of Arthur the interest which he
had at first excited. Even in the bosom of the court itself a party
had declared in his favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>'If you convict him I will never forgive you!' said the wife of the
judge-advocate to her husband, who was charged with the support
of the prosecution.</p>

<p>'I shall certainly convict him,' replied the magistrate, 'for I am
as well convinced of his guilt as if I had seen him commit the
crime.'</p>

<p>'And I would not believe it,' said Arthur's fair champion, 'even if
I had seen it.'</p>

<p>'It is a fortunate thing for society that women cannot serve on
juries,' replied the advocate-general, shrugging his shoulders; 'it
would be out of the question for them to convict a criminal, provided
he was five-and-twenty, well made, with bright eyes and
curling hair.'</p>

<p>In accordance with that law of gradation which seems so natural
that it is observed even in affairs of the greatest moment, the case
of Gorsay had been reserved for the last of the session. The petty
larcenies, misdemeanors, forgeries, murders without premeditation,
and other ordinary crimes, punishable at most with the galleys,
were first hurried over, exciting but little interest except in members
of the bar, and the habitual attendants upon the assizes: but
when the day came for the trial of the prisoners, whose names
were in all mouths, the court room was not large enough to contain
the crowds which early in the morning besieged its doors. Almost
the whole space allotted to the public on ordinary occasions was
now reserved for the more favored amateurs of justice. Many
young men, who had been on terms of intimacy with Arthur,
exhibited great curiosity to see how he would look when placed
upon the culprit's stand. These excellent friends, introduced within
the privileged inclosure, some by favor, others under the robes of
members of the bar, settled themselves clamorously on the seats of
the lawyers, behind the tribune, wherever in short they could find
a seat or foot-hold. By a gallant attention on the part of the president
of the assizes, the interior of the judgment-hall had been exclusively
reserved for ladies of condition, who were there crowded together,
bustling and buzzing like a swarm of bees in their hive. On the previous
evening, the greater part of these butterflies of fashion had
cast with dramatic effect their bouquets at the feet of Mademoiselle
Taglioni, who was then performing at Bordeaux; and now, with
the person half hid by a large veil, (at the court of assizes the veil
is etiquette, as the bouquet is at the theatre,) with pockets well
supplied with scent-bottles, and handkerchief in hand ready for the
expected tear, they were awaiting, but not in silence, the dénouement
of a drama more piquant than that of the theatre, and emotions
more touching than the enchantments of the Sylphide.</p>

<p>The simultaneous entrance of the court and prisoners produced
in this brilliant audience one of those sudden movements which
resemble the phenomena of electricity. The whole assemblage rose
with one movement; and soon it appeared that the women had the
advantage over the men; for all of them, even the most timid, in
the excitement of the moment, had sprung upon their chairs. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
plebeians in the hindmost ranks, protested with indignant outcries
against this screen of hats and shawls, which at such an interesting
moment hid from their gaze the spectacle so long and anxiously
waited for. Some time elapsed before the constables could restore
order and obtain silence: at length the female part of the audience
consented to be seated, and the plumed bevy settled down, as the
waves of the ocean subside when the tempest which excited them
has passed away.</p>

<p>All eyes, however, remained intently fixed upon the two accused,
who, in obedience to that principle of equality with which the law
regards all its victims, were placed side by side, the gentleman and
the galley-slave on the ignominious bench alloted to the prisoners.
Two months of captivity, the termination of which might be the
scaffold, had impressed upon the features of Arthur deep and
visible traces. The elegant young man, who during the preceding
winter had obtained in the most brilliant saloons of Bordeaux a
success which was due at least as much to his good looks as to his
wit, now presented himself to the companions of his happy days,
pale, wan, emaciated, and bearing on his countenance the impress
of a destiny, the horror of which, while he bowed before its sway,
he seemed fully to comprehend. But if his brow appeared colorless,
and his eye deprived of the fire which his fair admirers had
not unfrequently remarked in them, his countenance had at least
lost none of its firmness and noble aspect. Without deigning to
cast a look upon the man with whom he found himself coupled, nor
upon the audience which, with greedy eyes and ears, he heard
murmuring around him, like a pack of hounds yelping over their
prey, he exchanged a few words with his counsel, whose friendship
and devotion had been of long standing, and seated himself
with a composed air, and remained in a fixed attitude, apparently
indifferent to what was going on around him.</p>

<p>''Pon honor! the handsome d'Aubian is just now badly named,'
said a youngster with no small pretensions to good looks himself, to
one of his companions.</p>

<p>'The poor fellow cannot feel very much at his ease,' replied the
other, who had been on terms of the greatest intimacy with d'Aubian;
'guilty or not, I should be sorry to have him convicted. But
what an idea, to assassinate this poor old man! There were a
thousand other means to get money.'</p>

<p>'What means?'</p>

<p>'Why, not one of these women here would have refused to lend
him some.'</p>

<p>'Bah! women give, but do not lend,' said a third speaker, in a
sententious tone.</p>

<p>'And is not that the same thing?'</p>

<p>'Either plan is bad enough,' said the dandy, with a prudish air;
'for my part, I would as soon take to stealing.'</p>

<p>'Is Madame Chamesson here?' asked Arthur's friend, who by
thus naming a rich and superannuated old woman, from whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
young coxcomb was more than suspected of receiving supplies,
effectually closed his mouth.</p>

<p>In order to make a favorable impression upon the jury, Bonnemain,
who knew well the influence that the appearance of a prisoner
often makes upon them, had employed all the little arts of the toilet
which his person and situation would allow. Clad in a new suit,
(thanks to the ten louis' of Monsieur Gorsay,) newly shaven, with
modest and humble aspect, hands placed upon his knees, he held
himself in an attitude so benign and reverential, that at the sight of
this second Ambrose de Lamela, more than one spectator could not
help whispering to his neighbor, 'Is it possible that this can be a
liberated galley-slave? From his appearance, one would give him
absolution without confession.'</p>

<p>The empanneling of the jury, the reading of the decree of
reference and accusation, the interrogation of the accused, and the
deposition of a number of witnesses, took up the whole of the first
sitting; nor did the interest of the audience flag for a moment; but
the mysterious and tragic character of the drama did not develope
itself in all its deep import, until the second day, when from the
witness chamber came forth an old man whose white hair, imposing
features, and countenance calm in its severity, excited among all
ranks of spectators a murmur of pity and respect. It was Monsieur
Gorsay.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> two months, the sanguinary resentment in which the last
energies of a man on the verge of the tomb had been concentrated
had suffered no abatement; but it had by degrees undergone those
modifications which time and reflection always bring with them.
To the furious rage, the insatiable thirst for revenge, the blind
frenzy, which in the first instance had caused him to regard the
slightest delay in his vengeance as a mark of base imbecility, had
succeeded a determination cold, patient, implacable, and the more
terrible, inasmuch as instead of finding vent, it was restrained within
the recesses of his own bosom. By long boiling in the heart, that
crucible of flesh hotter than a brazen furnace, the disordered passions
came at length to cast off the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scoriæ</i> which changed the nature
of their temper. The last stage in this refining process is hypocrisy,
that wondrous power, which gains in depth what it hides upon the
surface, and whose burst, when it breaks forth, is like the explosion
of a volcano.</p>

<p>Monsieur Gorsay had thus comprehended the necessity of curbing
his vengeance in order to render it more effective. When he entered
the court-room, his countenance and deportment would have done
credit to a consummate actor. Far from betraying the deadly hate
which was gnawing at his heart, his eyes, as they rested for a
moment upon Arthur, only expressed a mournful compassion, by
which the audience were sensibly affected. At this look, in which
he had expected to have found rage but not deceitful pity, d'Aubian
felt that his doom was fixed; and replied by a bitter smile to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
magnanimous forgiveness with which the old man seemed to overwhelm
him. The eyes of Monsieur Gorsay then glanced over the
convict without resting on him; but in spite of the rapidity of the
movement, the expression was so significant, that to hide the impression
produced, Bonnemain turned away his head, and for some time
kept his eyes fixed steadily on the ground.</p>

<p>'What a fine old cock it is!' said he to himself; 'I was sure that
he would not send me to the gallows. A great comfort it will be to
him to have this tall fellow's neck stretched! Egad! had I been
married to such a pretty wife, I would have acted just so myself.
A bad fellow, that d'Aubian. When I think of the damage I was
going to do this respectable old gentleman, I feel quite ashamed of
myself. But what a devil of an idea to say to me, 'Bonnemain, rid
me of this man and you shall have ten thousand francs,' and then to
show me, at the same time, twenty thousand in that cursed secretary,
which wouldn't be opened! Who could hesitate between ten
thousand and twenty thousand?'</p>

<p>The most profound silence prevailed while Monsieur Gorsay
replied to the questions of form which the presiding judge of the
assizes put to him. This formality being finished, the old man sat
down in front of the bench and turned toward the jury; then in a
deep voice, the faltering tones of which seemed the effect of the
regret which a generous mind feels at being compelled to turn
accuser, he repeated word for word the declaration which he had
made on the day of the attempted assassination. This recital stated
in substance, that being asleep at the moment when he received
the first blow, Monsieur Gorsay, before losing entirely his consciousness,
had recognized the features of the murderer, who had lit a
taper to enable him to force the secretary.</p>

<p>'Look at the accused,' said the president to the witness; 'are you
quite sure that he whom you recognized was Arthur d'Aubian?'</p>

<p>The old man turned toward the prisoner, and cast upon the lover
of Lucia a look in which triumph was admirably veiled by the semblance
of pity. 'It was he indeed!' said he, with a sigh; 'in vain
do I wish not to recognize him.'</p>

<p>A general and prolonged sensation throughout the crowded audience
followed this declaration. Arthur alone remained apparently
unmoved, and contented himself with a scornful smile.</p>

<p>'Monsieur President,' said one of the jurors, when silence was
reestablished, 'I should like the witness to tell us whether prior to
this attempt there was any subject of enmity between the accused
and himself.'</p>

<p>This question excited a lively interest, particularly among the
females, who though constrained to believe in the guilt of Arthur,
could not admit that a robbery was the end in view. The prisoner
himself slightly colored, and seemed to experience a secret disquietude.
Monsieur Gorsay, however, was prepared for every interrogatory,
and this one gave him neither surprise nor trouble.</p>

<p>'Monsieur d'Aubian and myself,' replied he, 'have been for a long
time neighbors; and our intercourse has always been that of confidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
of cordiality, and I may say of friendship; and on my part
at least, spite of the blood that has been spilt, these sentiments are
not yet annihilated. I feel this in the deep grief I have experienced
these two months past; and I assure you that this unhappy event
has caused me more anguish of mind than bodily suffering.'</p>

<p>The altered voice and sad expression of countenance of the old
man excited in the audience a new murmur of pity.</p>

<p>'So then,' continued the president, 'you know of no cause to
which the attempt, of which you have been the victim, may be
attributed?'</p>

<p>'The cause,' replied Monsieur Gorsay, in a melancholy tone, 'is in
my opinion that deplorable passion for play, which has already
ruined so many young men worthy of a better fate. Monsieur
d'Aubian played deeply and unsuccessfully: my advice could not
withdraw him from this abyss, which every day became deeper. In
a moment of despair he must have thought of the money which he
had seen me receive some time before. Why did not the unfortunate
man ask me for it, instead of seeking to gain possession of it
in such a deplorable manner? If he had only placed confidence in
me; if he had considered that the purse of an old friend was at his
service; this fatal event could never have happened, and we should
not have been both here; I in despair at being his accuser, and
he&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The old man here paused, as if intense grief had cut short his
words; and his outstretched arm, which he had raised to designate
Arthur by a gesture of affection, dropped heavily to his side.</p>

<p>This touching discourse, this mock appearance of paternal grief,
produced among the spectators, and even on the benches of the
judges and jury, one of those thrilling emotions which honest hearts
always feel at the sight of an heroic action. Monsieur Gorsay, pitying
instead of heaping curses upon his assassin, appeared to the
pious part of the audience a most virtuous observer of the precepts
of the gospel; the men of letters compared him to Don Gusman
bestowing forgiveness upon Zamora; the women even, seduced by
a greatness of soul, set off by the long white hair, studied accent,
eyes expressive in spite of age; in a word, by all the dramatic
accessories which are so effective, suddenly transferred to the magnanimous
old man the interest which most of them until then had
preserved for the young accused.</p>

<p>'How handsome he must have been forty years ago!' cried one
of them, in an artless transport.</p>

<p>'He is so still,' replied her neighbor, outdoing her in this admiration;
'moral beauty has no age. What generosity! What nobleness!
I can now comprehend how Madame Gorsay should have
fallen dangerously ill at the prospect of losing him.'</p>

<p>'It is King Lear!' observed a romantic Philaminta, devoted to the
study of Shakspeare.</p>

<p>This epithet passed from mouth to mouth, and was sententiously
pronounced by those who scarcely understood its meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>'Have you any remarks to make upon the deposition of the witness?'
asked the president, addressing d'Aubian.</p>

<p>The accused arose, and seemed for a moment to be struggling
with a violent temptation, which he succeeded in conquering.</p>

<p>'For the sake of my memory,' said he, 'for it is not my life which
I would now defend, I must repeat that I am innocent of the crime
of which I am accused. As for the declaration of Monsieur Gorsay,
it is not for me to dispute it. Let your justice pronounce sentence;
I shall know how to submit to it.'</p>

<p>This protestation seemed as cold as it was constrained, and was
unfavorably received.</p>

<p>'Innocence does not express itself thus,' said to themselves the
greater part of the spectators; 'one does not submit passively to an
unjust sentence, but rather expresses indignation at it.'</p>

<p>A submission so extraordinary strengthened instead of destroying
the proofs. 'This man is guilty,' was the general impression; 'it is
written in his countenance.'</p>

<p>Monsieur Gorsay, having finished his testimony, took his seat
among the witnesses, overwhelmed on his passage with unequivocal
proofs of the deep interest he had excited.</p>

<p>For a few moments the audience were occupied in private converse;
but suddenly this confused murmur was changed to a death-like
silence, on the president's saying, in a voice which was heard
throughout all the assemblage, 'Introduce Madame Gorsay.'</p>

<p>An officer left the hall, and almost immediately returned, preceding
the young wife, who at once became the object of general curiosity.
With head erect, countenance glowing with a hectic flush, and the
inspired air of a Sybil, she advanced with firm step to the edge of
the stand on which the witnesses are placed when they give testimony.
There she stopped, apparently deaf to the words which the
president addressed to her. Her gaze, in which gleamed forth wildness,
ran over the crowded audience beneath her, with unnatural
boldness. Quickly catching the prisoners' seat, she fixed her eyes
upon d'Aubian with an unutterable look of eagerness, of love, and
of despair; then, with a gesture frenzied but not involuntary, Lucia
stretched out her arms toward her lover, and with a thrilling voice,
'Arthur!' exclaimed she, 'I am here!'</p>

<p>This cry of succor, fierce as the roar of a wounded lioness, sent
an electric shudder through the thousand veins of that crowded
multitude, greedy of emotions, and now supplied with them beyond
their most sanguine hopes. In the midst of the general confusion
two men arose, the husband and the lover; the one trembling with
rage, the other with pity.</p>

<p>'This is a trait of madness!' exclaimed Monsieur Gorsay; 'the
evidence of a mad woman cannot be received.'</p>

<p>'Mad!' said Lucia, casting a look of defiance toward her husband;
then turning to the president of the court, 'Question me, Sir;
you will see whether I am mad or not; whether I cannot comprehend
your questions, and answer them in a rational manner. Mad!
I may soon become so; but at this moment I have full possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
of my reason. I know perfectly well what I am doing, and what I
am saying.'</p>

<p>'Compose yourself, Madame, I pray you; I am about to put some
questions to you,' said the president, who thought he saw in the
eyes of Lucia the threatening gleams of insanity, which contradiction
might exasperate.</p>

<p>'Monsieur President, I object to this examination;' repeated
Monsieur Gorsay, in a half-choked voice; 'I shall prove that for
some time past the reason of my unhappy wife has been disturbed.
Monsieur Mallet, her physician, and one of the witnesses here present,
if he is willing to tell the truth, can testify to this fact.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur Mallet,' said the president, 'will you approach and
judge for yourself whether Madame is in a fit condition to undergo
an examination?'</p>

<p>Lucia smiled on the physician as he ascended the steps of the
stand, and stretched out her hand to him when he drew near, with
a gesture full of confidence. The possessor of a secret discovered
by his penetration, the physician would have suffered Arthur to
have been condemned, rather than have ruined a woman for whom
he had long felt an attachment almost paternal; but he did not carry
his chivalric refinement so far as to be willing to save her in spite
of herself, by keeping his mouth closed. 'A man's life is at stake,'
thought he; 'if she loves him well enough to sacrifice her happiness
for him, what right have I to prevent her?'</p>

<p>He took the arm of the young woman, to feel her pulse; a superfluous
formality, for it could teach him nothing which he knew not
already. 'Madame has a high fever,' said he, in the midst of
silence so profound that it seemed as if every breath was suspended;
'for two months this has been her habitual state. One of
the features of this malady, which the efforts of art have not yet
been able to subdue, is an irregular exacerbation, which the slightest
emotion increases; but between this irritation of the nervous system
and a disturbance of the mental faculties, there is, thank God! a
wide difference. Madame Gorsay, as she herself has just affirmed,
is in full possession of her reason; and I am convinced that she will
understand perfectly well the questions that may be put to her, and
also the import of her own answers.'</p>

<p>The audience received this declaration of the physician with a
murmur of satisfaction; and in its frivolous cruelty prepared to
devour the scandal, of which for a few moments it feared it would
have been deprived. Transported with rage, Monsieur Gorsay
would have clambered up the steps of the stand to drag down his
wife, but the gen d'armes prevented his passing, and he fell back
upon a bench, where he remained with face hid in his hands, apparently
insensible. Arthur, upon whom Lucia kept her eyes ardently
fixed, besought her by a look not to betray any farther a love, the
avowal of which must cover her with disgrace. In reply to this
mute prayer, he only obtained an impassioned gesture, which
expressed her unshaken resolution to save him or perish with him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a lively discussion was going on among the judges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
whose sagacity had not foreseen this romantic incident. For the
sake of public morals, the president wished to suppress the interrogation
of Madame Gorsay, who could throw no light on the main
fact of the assassination. He succeeded in bringing his colleagues
over to this opinion; but the public prosecutor, whose consent was
necessary, was not a man to give up, from motives of humanity, the
prospect of a development of additional crime, which being ingrafted
by him upon an accusation already capital, promised to make it one
of the most interesting criminal trials which the court of Bordeaux
had ever known. On being consulted by the president of the court,
the red-gowned accuser therefore briefly declared that the testimony
of the witness appeared to him to be indispensable.</p>

<p>During this discussion, Madame Gorsay remained upright and
motionless, earnestly gazing upon Arthur. The proudness of her
bearing at this moment might have seemed the effect of a masculine,
or rather a super-human energy, were it not for a tremor, almost
imperceptible, which forced her to lean her hand for support upon
the chair which had been placed for her.</p>

<p>To the questions of form which were addressed her by the president,
she replied in a clear and it might be said a composed manner;
but when he requested her to tell the jury what she knew
relating to the attempt made upon the person of her husband, she
paused for a few moments; not that vulgar timidity caused the
heroic determination of her heart to falter, but as if to collect at this
decisive moment her physical energies, which seemed almost ready
to abandon her.</p>

<p>'I have entered this place respected; I shall leave it disgraced!'
said she at length, in an altered but thrilling voice. 'It matters
little. Between <em>my</em> honor and <em>his</em> life I cannot hesitate. For ten
months Arthur d'Aubian has been my lover; Arthur d'Aubian is
my lover!' repeated she, with incredible energy, repressing with a
commanding gesture the murmuring which these words produced;
'for ten months I have received his visits in my apartment, frequently
at night. At the moment the crime was committed, I was awaiting
him; if he was found in the park, it was because there was no
other way to come to me. Arthur, I repeat, is my lover; who will
dare say that he is an assassin?'</p>

<p>'I will!' exclaimed Monsieur Gorsay, rising in a transport of
ungovernable fury.</p>

<p>'Then do you lie!' cried Lucia, whose look seemed to wither
the old man. 'This man lies!' continued she, pointing with her
finger to her husband. 'I have betrayed him; he knows it; and to
revenge himself, he accuses Arthur of a crime. I have myself proposed
to him to accuse me of the deed. I should not have denied
it; but he would not. The blood of a woman would not suffice
him; he must have that of Arthur; of Arthur whom I love, I do
not say more than my life&mdash;that would be but little&mdash;but more
than my honor!'</p>

<p>Lucia here interrupted herself, and cast her sparkling eyes
toward that part of the hall occupied by the female part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
audience, among whom a lively agitation was manifested, and
whose whisperings clearly condemned an avowal so contrary to all
received usages.</p>

<p>'You speak of immodesty,' said she to them, with a bitter smile.
'Spite of your want of pity, I would not wish any one of you to
become so wretched as to learn that there is yet one thing more
powerful than shame; and that is, despair. Think you, if the
scaffold were not in view, I should thus hold up my disgrace for
your contempt? They are about to kill him, I tell you; and must
I let him die, that your blushes for me may be spared?'</p>

<p>As she pronounced these last words, Lucia reeled and closed her
eyes, while a death-like paleness took the place of the burning hue
with which fever had colored her cheeks. The supernatural energy
which had thus far sustained her, suddenly gave way, as the flame
of a torch is extinguished by a blast of wind. Doctor Mallet, who
stood at the foot of the stand, watching with vigilant anxiety the
slightest movement of the young woman, threw himself forward
and received her in his arms the moment she fell. Others ran to
his assistance, and Lucia was speedily carried into the witnesses'
hall. She remained there for some time, apparently lifeless; but
soon there followed this swoon a succession of convulsions more
dreadful than any she had ever before experienced.</p>

<p>'The court is adjourned for half an hour,' said the president,
despairing of obtaining immediate silence or attention.</p>

<p>These words completely let loose the storm; and the audience-chamber
suddenly assumed the appearance of a tempestuous sea.
A hundred conversations, equally lively, took place at once. The
conduct of Madame Gorsay became the inexhaustible text for
comments the most violent and contradictory. Some thought her
crazy, others frightful, while a third class pronounced her sublime.
In general, the old men were of the first opinion, the women of the
second, and the young men of the third.</p>

<p>'How happy must this d'Aubian be!' exclaimed one of these
latter, in an extatic tone.</p>

<p>'Happy! to be on the culprit's seat!' replied with a sneer a man
of more mature years.</p>

<p>'And what matters that? Is there a humiliation which may not be
effaced, or a grief which cannot be consoled, by the happiness of
inspiring such a passion? Spite of its ignominy, even the culprit's
seat becomes a throne for him who reigns over such a noble heart.
Oh! to be loved thus&mdash;and die!'</p>

<p>The kindling eyes of the young enthusiast addressed this sentimental
exclamation to a pretty blonde, whose coquetry had kept
him for six months on the culprit's seat, while waiting for the
throne of love.</p>

<p>'To be loved is no doubt vastly agreeable,' replied the matter-of-fact
man; 'but to die! and upon the scaffold! Rather you than
I, my fine fellow!'</p>

<p>On resuming the sittings, the president gave notice that the very
critical situation of Madame Gorsay having rendered it necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
that she should be removed home, both the accusation and the
defence might have the benefit of her deposition, and that it would
remain for the jury to decide upon its value. 'The list of witnesses
is exhausted,' added he; 'Monsieur the Public Prosecutor has the
floor.'</p>

<p>In legislative and judicial discussions, those incidents which
sometimes turn up in a manner completely unexpected, are the
rocks on which ordinary speakers, whose presence of mind is disturbed
as soon as they are taken unawares, usually make shipwreck;
but which master minds, practised in debate, have the
power of adroitly turning to their own advantage. On the present
occasion, the public prosecutor, a native of Bordeaux, although in
other respects a superficial lawyer, possessed in common with many
of his countrymen the faculty of improvisation, which seems, by
one act of the mind, to combine thought and its expression. The
reverse of the Abbe de Verlot, he would have recommenced the
siege, and taken Malta, watch in hand, in ten different ways.
Without the least appearance of embarrassment at an event which
seemed to have changed the whole aspect of the proceedings, this
able tactician gradually developed the plan of the accusation, as
he had prepared it in the silence of his chamber. With the
unwearied patience of the ant, adding little by little, grain of sand
upon grain of sand, he heaped upon d'Aubian a mountain of proofs,
under which the strength of Hercules would have given way; and
then, when the mass seemed already sufficiently weighty, overwhelming,
and unmovable, he suddenly added, as a terrible and
unexpected crowning of the work, the deposition of Madame
Gorsay.</p>

<p>'In an excess of despair,' exclaimed he, in a pathetic tone, 'a
respectable old man, a husband cruelly outraged, tells you, 'This
woman is deranged.' A noble and a mournful untruth, which I
cannot blame, but which is still a falsehood! No, gentlemen; this
woman is not deranged; her physician tells you she is not. She is
not mad, unless you term madness the unbridled phrenzy of an
adulterous passion, which, with bold front and audacious eye,
unveils itself in the very sanctuary of justice, there to enact the
deplorable scene with which all hearts seem yet filled. By trampling
under foot all reserve, all modesty, Madame Gorsay thought
that she could save him whom she dares to call her lover. Unhappy
woman! Who did not see, that far from being a justification, her
disclosure only adds another proof to the accusation; a proof perhaps
the most overwhelming of all! What, in fact, does this
unheard of declaration prove? It proves this; that before carrying
murder into the house of Monsieur Gorsay, the accused had
commenced by the dishonor of his wife; thus making one crime
the prelude of another. And so it always happens: '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nemo repente
turpissimus</i>.' And what! is it pretended that this disgraceful stain
which has just been brought to the glare of day, can cover over the
shed blood? No, gentlemen; the blood still remains beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
mire, and nothing shall prevent our tracking it from the victim
directly to the assassin!'</p>

<p>The public prosecutor continued a long time in this strain,
adding weight to his words by impassioned gestures, and fervent
declamation. Proceeding from inductions to oratorical displays,
from arguments to appeals to the passions, he succeeded in making
the guilt of the accused a sort of luminous and baleful star, the
existence of which none but a blind man or an idiot could deny.
At the close of the peroration, Arthur stood convicted of having
attempted to assassinate Monsieur Gorsay, not only for the purpose
of getting possession of his money, but also that he might espouse
the unfaithful wife, who by her widowhood would become a desirable
object for a ruined gambler.</p>

<p>This eloquent piece of pleading produced upon the assemblage
an overwhelming and decided impression, which the advocate of
d'Aubian in vain endeavored to counteract. In vain he urged in
favor of his client the confession of Lucia, which explained so
naturally the circumstances metamorphosed by his opponent into
additional proofs of guilt. In vain he essayed to prove that the
deposition of Monsieur Gorsay was but a calumny inspired by
vengeance. In his rejoinder, more withering even than his first
speech, the prosecutor prostrated irrevocably in the dust every
position and argument of the defence.</p>

<p>The jury, who counted among their number but two unmarried
men, finding in the accused the seducer of a married woman, were
not on that account disposed to be more lenient. In their eyes the
offence against conjugal rights, instead of a palliation seemed an
increase of crime. After a long and serious deliberation, they
declared, by a majority of nine out of twelve, that Arthur d'Aubian
was guilty of a premeditated attempt to murder, followed by an
attempt at robbery. Bonnemain, against whom the prosecutor had
abandoned proceedings, was unanimously acquitted.</p>

<p>In spite of the lateness of the hour, almost all the audience had
remained in their places, that they might be present at the dénouement
of the drama. The two prisoners, who had been removed
from the hall while the foreman of the jury read their verdict, were
presently brought back, and listened with a sort of impassive
silence to the reading of the verdict, the requisition of the public
prosecutor for the pronouncing of sentence, and finally the double
decree pronounced by the judge. The only sign of joy manifested
by the galley-slave on being acquitted, was a guttural sound produced
by the eagerness with which he once more resumed the free
use of his respiration.</p>

<p>'I should like devilish well to have a cup of water, or even of
wine,' said he to the gen d'arme at his right.</p>

<p>Arthur received the verdict of the jury with firmness; but when
the president pronounced the sentence of the court, which condemned
him to twenty years hard labor in the galleys, his head
sunk upon his breast, and he remained for some time apparently
stupefied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>'Alphonse,' said he at length, in a low voice to his defender, who
was sitting in front of him, 'you have done what you could for me,
and I thank you; but the moment has come: remember your
promise.'</p>

<p>'It is not a decree of death!' replied the young advocate, turning
deadly pale.</p>

<p>'It is the decree of a thousand deaths!' replied the condemned,
with energy; 'would you have me go to the galleys? Remember
your oath; you could not save my life&mdash;at least preserve my honor.'</p>

<p>He bent forward toward his friend; their hands met and interchanged
a long and mysterious embrace. On resuming his position,
Arthur saw, rising from the midst of the dense crowd, a lean
and sinister figure, whose devouring eyes were fastened upon him
with an expression of ferocious triumph. He replied to the fury of
this look with the calm and disdainful smile of a man who rises
superior to his fate.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Gorsay,' said he, in a firm tone, 'look at me well, that
you may not forget me at your hour of death!'</p>

<p>With these words, Arthur applied to his breast the point of the
dagger which his friend had just given him, and with a firm hand
buried it in his heart. He remained for a moment upright, his eyes
wide open and fixed upon the old man, whom their terrible fascination
filled with involuntary dread, and then suddenly fell like a tree
severed by the axe.</p>

<p>A cry of horror arose on all sides. 'Dead!' exclaimed Doctor
Mallet, who was among the first to hasten to him. 'She mad, and
he dead! My God! may Thy judgment be more merciful for them
than that of men!'</p>

<p>'Dead! very dead indeed!' said Bonnemain, in his turn leaning
over the body of the young man stretched at his feet. 'To stick
himself in that fashion because he was sentenced for twenty years!
What a fool!'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> months after the trial, on a gloomy winter's evening,
Doctor Mallet entered the house of Monsieur Gorsay, to which,
since their return from Bordeaux, he had been a daily visitant.
Without asking for the old man, he ascended immediately to the
apartment of Lucia, whose alarming situation required the assiduous
attentions which the physician bestowed upon her with untiring
devotion. He gently opened the door of her chamber, and
approached the bed of the young woman, who seemed lying in a
lethargic slumber. Without awaking her, he placed his finger on
her throbbing pulse, and then with anxious hand gently pressed her
forehead, which he found to be burning like the alabaster of an ever-lighted
lamp.</p>

<p>'The fever increases, and the brain is becoming more and more
affected,' said he to himself, shaking his head with a care-worn
aspect. He then stood for some time, contemplating with mournful
compassion the sufferer whose life he still hoped to save, but of
whose reason he despaired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>'I am sure that something has happened here since yesterday,'
said he at length, in a low voice, to a female somewhat advanced
in years, and of a masculine exterior, who stood before the fire-place
awaiting the doctor's orders.</p>

<p>'I have taken care of many sick persons,' replied the nurse, with
uplifted hands and eyes, 'but have never seen such things as are
going on here. In the first place, last night Madame gets up fast
asleep, as she often does, but this time she tried to throw herself
out of the window. She had got herself half over the balcony
before I could get her in again.'</p>

<p>'You have been asleep then?' said Monsieur Mallet, in a tone of
anger.</p>

<p>'Why I might have had a little sand in my eyes; one is not
made of iron. But it was lucky I had a strong arm; if it hadn't
been for that, this poor lady would not now have had any need of a
doctor. But this is nothing to what took place here this morning.'</p>

<p>'Has Monsieur Gorsay been up here?' asked the doctor quickly.</p>

<p>'You have hit it. And Madame, as soon as she saw him, fell
into convulsions which lasted more than two hours. It took four of
us to hold her; and then we could hardly do it. When her strength
was all gone she fell asleep from weakness; but I have an idea that
this sleep bodes nothing good.'</p>

<p>The recital of the nurse was here interrupted by a slight noise
which the door made as it was partly opened. The physician
briskly turned his head, and saw Monsieur Gorsay, who had stopped
at the threshold. Hastening toward him, he thrust him back into
the other apartment.</p>

<p>'You must not enter here!' said he to him in a tone of command.
'This morning you took advantage of my absence; but
now you must obey me. What is it that you wish? Would you
complete your work by killing her?'</p>

<p>'She is asleep,' replied the old man, in a submissive voice. I
beseech you, doctor, let me enter. What do you fear? she sleeps;
she will not see me.'</p>

<p>'Do you not know the strange lucidness of her slumbers? Even
though sleeping, she will be aware of your presence.'</p>

<p>'Let me but look at her for a single moment,' said Monsieur Gorsay.
'This morning I had scarcely a glimpse of her; and you have
kept me so long from her! Am I condemned never to see her
again?'</p>

<p>'Your presence would kill her,' replied the doctor; 'as long as I
am her physician, I shall oppose an interview for which there is no
good object, and which cannot be other than injurious. In her
present deplorable condition, the least increase of excitement would
prove fatal. Spare her then, for Heaven's sake! Does not the
blood of Arthur d'Aubian suffice you? Must you also have that of
this unhappy woman?'</p>

<p>The old man bowed his head with a mournful air, and remained
some moments before replying. Then turning toward Monsieur
Mallet a look of the deepest despair:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>'Doctor,' said he, in a tremulous voice, 'could my death save her,
most willingly would I die this moment. But what can I, a miserable
old man, do upon the earth? An object of horror and affright,
without family, without friends, without children! She was all
these to me; she was my joy, my happiness, my treasure. Ah!
why was she not my daughter? Perhaps she then would have
loved me!'</p>

<p>'But of what use are regrets, when the evil is past remedy?'</p>

<p>'Past remedy! I know of one, but it requires a courage which I
no longer possess; for old age has weakened my spirit, and leaves it
only the strength to suffer. Do you believe me, doctor? I have
never been a coward; but now&mdash;I dare not kill myself. Think
not that it is religion that restrains me; it is fear. I have the
desire for suicide, but not the courage. <em>He</em> had it. He! young and
beloved&mdash;<em>he</em> knew how to die. And I, so near the tomb that I have
but to raise the stone to descend into it, I hesitate, and tremble!
Weakness and cowardice&mdash;these are man's last companions!'</p>

<p>Monsieur Gorsay seemed to forget the presence of the physician,
and re-descended to his apartment with slow and painful steps.
He there passed the remainder of the evening motionless in his
arm-chair, with head sunk upon his breast, eyes fixed, and draining
drop by drop the inexhaustible sadness in which for many months
his heart had been steeped. At eleven o'clock a domestic entering
the room, he arose and permitted himself to be undressed with the
passiveness of a machine: then, after swallowing a narcotic
draught, which his sleeplessness had rendered necessary, he got
into bed.</p>

<p>The most profound silence reigned throughout the house; the
domestics had long since retired to their apartments. The lethargic
sleep of Lucia still continued; and despite the occurrence of the
preceding night, the nurse, according to her custom, was slumbering
in the arm-chair. At length Monsieur Gorsay fell asleep. Suddenly
the old man was aroused by the sound of the window-blind
turning upon itself. Opening his eyes, he perceived with amazement,
mingled with terror, a large band of silver which the moon
projected through the shutters of the Venetian blinds upon the
carpet. In a moment this was obscured by the figure of a man,
who leaped into the room, and proceeded directly toward the bed
with the rapid and stealthy tread of a tiger. Monsieur Gorsay
endeavored to rise, but before he could utter a cry, or seize the bell-rope,
he was assailed and thrown down by the robber, who with
one hand grasped him by the throat, and with the other brandished
a long knife, which he had carried open between his teeth.</p>

<p>'Mercy!&mdash;Bonnemain!' murmured the old, man, who by the
light of the moon had just recognized the murderer.</p>

<p>'Not a word! or I strike!' replied the galley-slave, in a low voice.
'Listen to me: you must get up, open the secretary, and give me
the money. If you hold your tongue I will do you no harm; but if
you attempt to speak a single word, I will let out your blood like
that of a fowl! Do you understand me?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Frozen with terror, Monsieur Gorsay made a sign of assent. He
then arose, with the assistance of Bonnemain, who by way of precaution
kept fast hold of his arm, took a key from the pocket of his
riding-coat, opened the secretary and drew from the secret cavity
the casket filled with gold, upon which, for the last five months, the
galley-slave, by night and by day, had not ceased thinking.</p>

<p>'Is this the whole?' said he, as his eyes gloated over the prey.</p>

<p>'It is all that I have here,' replied Monsieur Gorsay, in a half
articulate voice; 'but I have some silver in the library; must I go
and bring it?'</p>

<p>'Thank you; you might alarm the servants, which would not be
so pleasant. Too much appetite is hurtful. I must be content with
the rouleaus.'</p>

<p>'Take them then; I give them to you; and I swear never to
betray you.'</p>

<p>'I believe you; before an hour the beaks will be on my haunches,
as the other time; not such a fool!'</p>

<p>With these words, the galley-slave, by a movement as rapid as
unforeseen, passed behind Monsieur Gorsay, grasped him tightly,
closed his mouth with his left hand, while with the other he stabbed
him in the side with anatomical precision. Stricken to the heart,
the old man bit convulsively the fingers of the assassin, uttered a
stifled groan, and expired. Bonnemain laid him upon the floor in
silence, and assured himself that no pulse beat any longer. Certain
then of never being denounced by his victim, he arose and plunged
his hand into the casket which stood upon the secretary. At this
instant, the noise of a door opening sent an icy chill through his
veins. He turned in confusion, and by the light of the moon, which
alone illuminated the scene of murder, he discerned at the entrance
of the chamber a figure in white, which to a superstitious mind
might have seemed the avenging spirit of the murdered man. This
apparition moved directly up to the assassin, who in his fright dropped
both the dagger and the rouleaus of gold. Crawling on his hands
and knees, he succeeded in regaining the window, through which
he sprung with a desperate effort. He traversed the garden, scaled
the wall of the inclosure, and fled across the country, bearing on his
hands, as on the former occasion, blood but no gold.</p>

<p>Two hours after this, the attendant of Madame Gorsay awoke,
and perceived that the bed of her charge was empty. Alarmed,
she ran to the window but found it closed; she then saw that the
door was partly open. Lighting a taper, she followed from chamber
to chamber the tracks of the somnambulist, who in her progress
had not closed any of the doors behind her. She at length came
to the threshold of the chamber of Monsieur Gorsay, where she
suddenly stopped, uttering a shriek of horror, which aroused and
terrified the whole household.</p>

<p>In the full moonlight which illuminated part of the room, Lucia,
with dishevelled hair and closed eyes, was sitting by the dead body
of her husband. The childish amusement in which she seemed to
be seriously engaged told that the wanderings of madness were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
joined to those of somnambulism. She held the casket on her
knees, turned out the rouleaus, one after the other, and scattered
the pieces of gold upon the carpet, arranging them in symmetrical
figures. The blood which flowed profusely from the old man's
wound was mingled with this sport, and the fingers of the smiling
idiot were dabbled in the purple gore.</p>

<p>Lucia, dragged from the fatal chamber, awoke only to fall into
terrible convulsions, during which the last rays of reason seemed to
be extinguished. The scene which had been enacted five months
before on this spot was now repeated in a more fatal manner. The
judicial inquest established in a positive manner that Madame
Gorsay, in a fit of somnambulism, had assassinated her husband,
against whom, since the death of Arthur d'Aubian, she had cherished
an implacable hatred. It also appeared clearly demonstrated that
she had only perpetrated during sleep a murder which had been
long contemplated during her waking hours. Among the parties
who held the inquest there were more than one who thought that
even sleep was not a sufficient excuse for the deed, and that the
matter ought to be brought before a jury; but the insanity of the
accused having been legally proven, took away all pretext for a
criminal procedure. Instead, therefore, of being incarcerated in a
prison, the wretched widow was placed in a lunatic asylum; a step
which to many seemed too lenient.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day in the year 1838, among the persons whom curiosity
had brought to the Institution at Charenton, might be seen a citizen
of some fifty years of age, fat, well-conditioned, ruddy, and with
clothes very well brushed. He gave his arm to a buxom female
bedecked in full suit of holiday attire, and a finger to a child of
about four years of age, whom maternal vanity had equipped in the
martial uniform of an artillery officer. This group, a type of city
felicity, the last reflex of patriarchal manners, was one which might
have brought a smile of malice to the lip of an artist, or have
furnished food for more serious reflection to a philosopher.</p>

<p>The head of this interesting family, who was about taking his
son in his arms to give him a better view of the inmates of the
establishment, suddenly stopped at sight of a female patient, still
young and beautiful, who, without paying attention to any one, was
walking up and down the small inclosure, repeating in a plaintive
tone the name of 'Arthur.'</p>

<p>'What on earth ails you, Monsieur Bonnemain?' said the tawdry
lady to her spouse. 'Why, you are as white as a sheet, and are all
in a tremble!'</p>

<p>'It is from hunger then,' replied the old galley slave, as he recovered
his sang froid, who, thanks to the dowry of his wife, had
become the head of a flourishing commercial establishment; 'let
us go to dinner. Achille is sleepy. These fools amuse me no
longer. We have had enough of this stuff!'</p>

<h2><a name="SKETCHES_OF_EAST-FLORIDA" id="SKETCHES_OF_EAST-FLORIDA">SKETCHES OF EAST-FLORIDA.</a></h2>

<h3>NUMBER ONE.</h3>

<p class="center">'OFFICER OF THE NIGHT.'</p>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> few antipathies, but there are some that I do battle with
at sight or smell. Whether persons or things, I <em>appreciate</em> them at
once; as some persons of keen perceptions will tell immediately
when a cat is near them. You will hear people talk of what they
call a 'presentiment of evil.' This is all humbug. If they would
look about them, they would find, each one, his respective cat; or,
to speak magnetically, his 'opposite pole.'</p>

<p>Corporal F&mdash;&mdash; was my antipathy, my 'opposite pole,' my cat;
and for that matter, a <em>Tom</em>-cat, and a very saucy one. We had
never spoken, and knew nothing of each other; our eyes had never
met, but we had stolen glances, each way, giving strong confirmation
of what the mere presence of each sufficiently indicated; to wit, a
decided hostility. I had felt uncomfortable some mornings before,
and knew perfectly well that I had a cat to find; but I did <em>not</em> know,
till afterward, that Corporal F&mdash;&mdash; had reached town that very day.
It was a common fancy with me, subsequently, that I knew what
part of the town he was in at any given time; and this may have
been fancy only, or it may have been a fact magnetical.</p>

<p>Our first meeting was in &mdash;&mdash;, East Florida. I had been in that
warm-bath of a climate just long enough to get well soaked through,
and was beginning to act out that dreamy languor of body and soul
that fits one so exactly for the cigar-life&mdash;the lounging, easy nonchalance
of that sunny land; in short, without that excess of high
spirits which is an irritation, I was superlatively happy&mdash;till I met
Corporal F&mdash;&mdash;. He was to me immediately a large spot on the
sun; and although I couldn't always <em>see</em> the spot, I knew it was there,
and keeping off so much sunshine. His arrival, as I viewed it, was
impertinent, and not at all in aid of the object I had in coming a
thousand miles to that delicious climate. With a generous ingenuity,
I thought at first of proposing to him to draw cuts, to decide which
of us should leave town. He had not the look of being cared for,
and I could not imagine his absence would be missed at all, except
by me; while as to myself, to say nothing of the party I was with,
I rather thought that the girls who had taken so much pains to teach
me their waltzes and Spanish dances&mdash;&mdash;But that's no matter.
The risk to me would be an unrighteous one, and the project was
abandoned.</p>

<p>We were a party of half a dozen, who had left New-York as the
severe winter of '35 and '36 was setting in, and reached &mdash;&mdash; by
way of Picolata, making the last safe passage over that road. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Indian war had just broken out, and the whole country was in arms.
Shortly after our arrival, the north part of the town was picketed off
at about half a mile from the outskirts, with a guard, here and there;
and a cordon of military posts stretched along the western side,
around to the sea. A large gun was then placed in the middle of
H&mdash;&mdash;'s bridge, pointing into the pine barrens; the usual night
patrol of southern cities was doubled, and the place declared under
'martial law.' Every able-bodied man was expected to do service;
and if that expectation failed to be met by any one, that 'individual'
was assisted by a corporal and guard. I was an 'able-bodied man;'
sound in every particular. The hot sun had already browned my
face so that there were no delicate indices of ill health; and if I had
been a shade darker, I might have been knocked off at the market
for at least seven hundred dollars. I was full of '<i>tusymusy</i>,' and
ready for any thing, but wished to be myself the master of the 'how
and when' of any enterprise that I was to engage in.</p>

<p>I was anticipated. Happening to criticise the appearance of the
different companies about town, in too public a manner, the sovereigns
were offended, and it was resolved that I should be victimized.
I was ordered to appear at the Fort, armed and equipped for immediate
service, as one of a small guard of Minorcans and Spaniards,
posted a mile and a half out of town; of which guard, Bravo was
corporal, and &mdash;&mdash; captain; precisely as I should like to have put
them in a shipping-bill for the East-Indies. Well, I declined the
invitation. I was from the 'mountain-land,' and for some days, my
blood had been going up with the thermometer, at the strange goings-on
about town. There appeared to me a quite unnecessary preparation
of powder for mere home consumption. Beside, what did <em>I</em>
know about war, that they should select me, when the streets were
full of Uncle Sam's men, and hardly room enough for them at the
outskirts to spread their tents? I did <em>not</em> call at the Fort. I didn't
even send my card, or my regret. Of course I was not surprised the
next morning, at parade hours, to see Corporal Bravo and guard
coming down the street with apparently hostile intentions. It might
be accident that they approached so near the house; but people
in that climate never move without an object; and I accordingly
passed through a gate in the rear, merely to air myself in a different
direction. Bravo enquired for me very particularly at the house,
breathed a few moments his men, who were in a high excitement;
made a rapid revolution, and marched back to the Fort, a mile distant,
to report that I was not to be found. At afternoon parade, the
same military movement was repeated, and I had again the same
charming view of the H&mdash;&mdash; turkey-buzzards and small snipes on
the beach, with fiddlers innumerable, and in the back-ground the pine
woods of the wilderness.</p>

<p>After a few days, I was trapped by mere civility; a very <em>forcible</em>
thing, by the way, as all women know very well, but there are men
who never can learn it. A polite note came from the captain, asking
me to call at his quarters; and I was very soon ushered into a room
that was lined with muskets and swords and men to use them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
captain received me pleasantly, complimenting me upon my 'esprit
du corps' in being master of my own company, etc; but I saw the
game at once; and bursting into a laugh at the savage looks of the
guard, surrendered at once, merely asking the courtesies of a prisoner
of war. I was immediately gratified&mdash;with three muskets, one
for myself, the others to protect me on either wing, carried by friends
who insisted on an arm each side; and so with a strong support in
the rear by the rest of the guard, and Bravo in front, cutting the way
with a drawn sword, we marched to the Fort. When we entered
the walls, and came in sight of the commandant, I expected to be
'cut in sunder at the waist,' but was merely noticed with a careless
severity, and told to look on, and be ready at the next parade. We
then assumed the form of a rhomboid, in which I was at equal distances
from the respective angles, and marched a mile and a half to
the camp. After showing me 'the fortifications,' which consisted of
a pine-board enclosure of about ten feet by twelve, I was taken into
the hot sun to be drilled privately. This was a very short operation.
I handled the musket with a kind of desperation, which very soon
convinced the corporal that I had the 'real stuff' in me; especially
in my last man&oelig;uvre, which consisted in cocking the piece suddenly,
and lowering the muzzle to his breast; upon which, with military
abruptness, he declared the drill over, and myself perfectly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fait</i>
at all military operations.</p>

<p>I was now instructed in other arts and mysteries of war; and was
told, among other things, that an officer from town generally visited
each camp during the night, and that then every man was to be
belted and ready for inspection. When the sentry received, in
answer to his challenge, '<i>Officer of the Night</i>,' his duty was to cry
out, for timely notice at the camp: '<i>Corporal of the Guard&mdash;Grand
Rounds&mdash;Officer of the Night</i>.' This, in Bravo's opinion, was the
grandest of all military affairs that were executed without waste of
powder. The officer of the night had not been round, for a week,
but he was always to be expected. Bravo and myself were very
soon on excellent terms. I rather liked him, in spite of the burlesque
of his name; for as such men generally do, he had contrived
to assume something so like his translation, that it passed very well
for the real article. If he did not fulfill his full meaning, his efforts
were at least well-meant, and he had a saucy good humor that was
quite companionable. That night we had two sentries out, stationed
some hundred yards each side of the camp; and somewhere about
the 'small hours' I took my first 'stand at arms' on the northern
pass, and challenging noises all night, without reply, acquitted myself
very much to the corporal's satisfaction. A few days passed
very pleasantly away, and I was enjoying my military life so much
that I had entirely forgotten Corporal F&mdash;&mdash;. It should be premised,
that I knew nothing of his being a corporal, and cared as little. I
had no objection to his being a perfect Nabob, if he would only keep
out of my way. I now learned that he had command of the next
post north of us, and only about half a mile distant.</p>

<p>One charming morning, after an 'off night,' when I was allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
to stay in town, I sallied into the street, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to the parade-ground,
humming to myself in mocking-bird style, my belt snug and faultlessly
white, and musket leaning with an off-duty obliquity that was
not pardonable merely, but quite the thing, when I suddenly <em>felt</em> that
Corporal F&mdash;&mdash; was in the street! He was not to be seen, but I
knew perfectly well that he was standing in a shop-door, only a short
distance ahead. The streets in that old town are very narrow, so
that on meeting a cart, the safest way is to post yourself flatwise
against the wall, and admire the prospect in the opposite direction
till the cart is cleverly by. Of course the foot-paths, such as they
are, are close to the wall, and give no room for steps to houses,
where, as in most cases, they are built directly on the street. I was
on the same side with Corporal F&mdash;&mdash;. If in passing, the corporal
should attempt the street, there would be a collision. These mathematical
problems suggested that I could cross over, as it was only
a long straddle, but I had no desire to do so. Almost unconsciously,
however, my musket went to the perpendicular, my eyes fixed where
I thought the north star ought to be, (magnetic coincidence!) and
my marching-foot was coming down with extra emphasis, at a point
just abreast of him, when I thought&mdash;it might be imagination&mdash;but
I thought his foot moved out slightly from the threshold. Quick as
the thought, which was lightning in my then state of the brain, I
wheeled, brought my musket with a ring upon the lime-stone, and
looked Corporal F&mdash;&mdash; dead in the face! He returned the look with
less interest than I expected, but he didn't waver a hair, and our
eyes fixed upon each other as steadily as though we had been
playing at small-swords. There was barely breathing room between
us; and at one time his lips moved as about to speak, but he said
nothing. Of course, <em>I</em> had nothing to say, but if <em>he</em> had any explanation
to make, I was then ready to hear it; and if not&mdash;&mdash;I was
going on in this manner to myself, when it occurred to me that he
was unarmed, and I had a musket, with a tremendous bore, (especially
a great bore of a hot day) and a ball then in it, that I would
not have dared to have sent within three points of the most distant
vessel in the offing. Without taking my eye from him, I resumed
my up-street facing; the accenting foot forward, musket to shoulder,
and immediately marched up street.</p>

<p>If Bravo had seen this evolution, and my march up the street, how
smoothly he would have rolled out his Spanish braggadocia upon my
military training! As I passed under balconies loaded down with
gay girls, fingers may have been kissed at me; quite likely; I never
knew, for I went 'right on' with set teeth to the Fort.</p>

<p>And now, would Corporal F&mdash;&mdash; challenge? I certainly had given
him a chance, and I was in a perfect fever to bring matters to a crisis.
I am not a fighting man. I never eat veal, or any thing that's killed
young; preferring to wait till I am convinced that from wet days
and cold winters the beast must have become indifferent to a knock
on the head: but who could refuse his antipathy? Who could live
in the same air with his tom-cat?</p>

<p>The day passed&mdash;and I was not challenged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>That night, as we lay about the camp-fire, I was possessed of a
sudden inspiration, and immediately gave a loud shout. Bravo
looked up enquiringly, and Boag, who was privy to my antipathy,
sprang to his feet, ready for any emergency. Boag knew that something
was in the wind. I paid no attention to either of them, but
called up Tom, my errand-boy, and gave him the requisites, with a
pass, for a gallon of Santa Cruz, sugar, etc; and all the eggs he
could find in town, and then despatched a few men with a boat, for
a load of oysters.</p>

<p>Boag was the only other American in our camp. He happened
in Florida, in what manner I don't know, from Charleston, South-Carolina,
and fell an easy victim, having been captured before I had
that pleasure. He was the happiest man I ever knew; happy in
every thing he undertook, and careful not to undertake too much.
His sagacity upon that point alone would have made a character of
any ordinary man. The mere motion of the man seemed to be a
high enjoyment, and his bowling at nine-pins was the very perfection
of carelessness. He was never guilty of a 'spare,' and would
have shuddered at the nicety and precision of hitting any particular
pin. But Boag's highest happiness, literally and technically, was in
his composition of egg-nogg. Egg-nogg from Boag was irresistible;
a smooth, and chaste production: the white of a pullet's egg, deliciously
flavored, was all you could think of, until&mdash;some time after
taking it.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock, the roast and 'nogg were ready; and then, as
we grouped about the fire you should have looked in upon us, to
have seen happy faces. The Spaniards in a perfect sputter of talk
and gesticulation as though every oyster burnt to the stomach; Boag
presiding every where with his stick; and myself, the Mephistophiles
of the occasion, lying on a board, the windward side of the group,
taking just enough of the 'nogg to digest each particular oyster, and
no more. Toward midnight, they had worried themselves sleepy,
and crept off to their berths. Bravo bringing up the rear, and laying
himself out in a very grand manner, his legs and arms indicating all
points of the compass, to signify, I suppose, that he ruled in all
directions. After waiting a suitable time for the sentries to become
careless, I beckoned to Boag, whose intuition was as perfect as a
woman's, and he followed me stealthily into the long salt grass bordering
the beach. The sentries were ordered to fire immediately
upon any one who refused to answer their challenge; and knowing
that the sentry we had to pass was only half-drunk, I had a painful
apprehension that the egg-nogg was after all a questionable fore-thought.
We had gained but a short distance, when the quick
challenge sent us headlong in the grass. The sentry couldn't leave
his post, and probably concluded that some wild fowl had risen between
him and the sky, and settled down again. Emerging again,
at about the same distance on the other side of the sentry, we were
again challenged, and made our salaam, as before, in the same unhesitating
manner. Presently the challenge was repeated, and we
thought we heard the click of his musket. The night was painfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
still, and it might be the sharp cry of a disturbed snipe, or the snapping
of a brand at the camp-fire. We were breathless 'for a space,'
and the musketoes seemed to know perfectly well that we durst not
raise a finger to brush them off. Then creeping along till we were
sure of being within the shade of the forest, we came to the perpendicular
again, and walked on rapidly to the camp of Corporal F&mdash;&mdash;.
I hinted to Boag to keep calm, and ready for any thing that might
turn up; at which he looked amazed, but said nothing; no doubt
wondering that I had not yet learned to appreciate him. At this
moment, we received an abrupt challenge from the advanced guard
of Corporal F&mdash;&mdash;. I shouted back, with all the strength of egg-nogg,
the magic words, '<i>Officer of the Night!</i>' And oh! what a
relief to that sentry, as he made the pine woods ring with '<i>Corporal
of the Guard&mdash;Grand Rounds&mdash;Officer of the Night!</i>'</p>

<p>Turkey-buzzards flew about on the tree-tops, and the whole
family of wild fowl, coughed and wheezed out their disturbance
upon the still night. Then arose the hum of the camp. A dozen
sleepy Spaniards sprang from their berths, swearing vociferously;
lights waved, swords clattered to the hip, and down came Corporal
F&mdash;&mdash;, with his men superbly belted, their heads leaning back to the
north star, and muskets flashing in the torch-light of three negroes
coming on before.</p>

<p>At a short distance from us, Corporal F&mdash;&mdash; gave a tremendous
'Halt!' upon which, I made two steps forward, and waving off the
little niggers to the right and left, stood in bold relief&mdash;the Officer
of the Night.</p>

<p>'Well, of course Corporal F&mdash;&mdash; drew his sword, and 'cut you in
sunder at the waist?'</p>

<p>Not at all; but if that column of men, together with Corporal
F&mdash;&mdash;, had immediately fallen over backward, I could not have been
better satisfied of their astonishment. The short silence was so
terrible to Boag, that feeling he must say something, he suggested
a want of candles, in a feeble way; and then, with a hurried
'Right about face&mdash;march!' the Corporal and guard vanished in
the darkness.</p>

<p>Reader, I am sorry to hoax you, but there was no catastrophe.
An antipathy looked dead in the face is always <em>pointless</em>. I was not
challenged by Corporal F&mdash;&mdash;; and as corporal, I never saw him
after that night. I never knew his name; and it is quite probable
that five years afterward I passed my wine to him in that same old
antiquated town. There was a face at our hotel that reminded me
very much of Corporal F&mdash;&mdash;; but with five years, my antipathy had
gone, and my tom-cat was a very clever companion.</p>

<h2><a name="FIORELLOS_FIDDLE-STICK" id="FIORELLOS_FIDDLE-STICK">FIORELLO'S FIDDLE-STICK.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BY A NEW CONTRIBUTOR.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the men of rank in London, who were distinguished during
the last century for their love of music, the Baron Baygo held a
prominent place. This worthy man found music in every thing.
Did a door creak upon its hinges, did a chair make a shrill sound in
gliding over the floor, presto! in an instant our melomaniac seizes
his tablets and marks down the corresponding musical inflections.
There was not, in short, an itinerant merchant of the streets of London
whose favorite cry had not been reproduced in the collection of
Baron Baygo. To speak truth, however, it must be confessed that
the musical education of our Baron had not been of the most thorough
character, being rather superficial than solid. He was consequently
obliged to have recourse to an amanuensis to note down for him, in
a proper and artist-like manner, all the noises, good, bad, or indifferent,
which figured in his musical <em>agenda</em>.</p>

<p>To procure a person of sufficient tact and patience to understand
and humor all the Baron's whims, it may readily be imagined was
no easy task. Having changed a score of times his musical secretaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
he succeeded however at length in attaching to him the
celebrated Fiorello, an Italian violinist of rare talent, and as simple
and candid in character as the majority of his countrymen are crafty
and astute.</p>

<p>Still the Baron, in spite of the three hours which he devoted
every day to the practice of the violin, could never attain the faculty
of playing with correctness; and his harmonicidal hand was continually
entangled in difficulties, and made sad havoc with the
doleful-sounding flats.</p>

<p>Fiorello was almost in despair. At length, the Baron, one day
throwing his violin on the floor, cried out in a rage: 'Yes! I have
already restrained myself too long; but patience! I am determined
that these cursed flats shall bother me no longer!'</p>

<p>'What is it you mean, my Lord?' said Fiorello, in astonishment.</p>

<p>'Why I mean to say,' replied the Baron, 'that this very night I
will make a motion in the House of Lords, to oblige musical composers
from henceforth to leave out all those infernal flats from their
music, under a heavy penalty.'</p>

<p>'Ah ha!' said Fiorello, bursting into laughter; 'the proposal will
be a pleasant one.'</p>

<p>'It will at least have a good moral effect, Sir,' replied the Baron,
with dignity. 'Have we not a statute against profane swearing?'</p>

<p>'Certainly, my lord.'</p>

<p>'Well then, were it not for these vile flats, I should not have
broken it, for my own part, more than a thousand times, since I commenced
the practice of the violin.'</p>

<p>It never appeared, however, that the Baron carried his threat into
execution.</p>

<p>One day, when the Baron, after three years of close application,
had come to handle the bow passably well, and could execute with
tolerable correctness a solo of Jarnovich, leaving out the flats, he
declared to Fiorello that he had made up his mind to give his friends
a taste of the first fruits of his newly-acquired talent; and he accordingly
directed him to make arrangements for a concert for the ensuing
Saturday.</p>

<p>By order of the Baron, notes of invitation were sent out to princes
of the royal family, to the grand dignitaries of the united kingdoms,
to the speakers of the two houses of parliament, and to the lord-mayor
of London. So well known in high life were the foibles and
eccentricities of the Baron, that each one took a malicious pleasure
in accepting the invitation.</p>

<p>The day appointed for the concert at length arrived. Fiorello was
very thoughtful; and at breakfast, spite of the repeated invitations of
the Baron's niece, a sprightly girl of sixteen, with whom he sat at
table, scarcely swallowed a mouthful.</p>

<p>'What ails you, my good master?' said Miss Betsey to him.</p>

<p>'Alas! Miss,' replied the poor musician, 'I fear that his lordship
will compromise this evening my twenty years of honorable professorship.'</p>

<p>'What! is that all, Signor Fiorello? Is not your reputation already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
sufficiently established? Take my advice; place yourself on the
side of the laughers; and believe me, they will be the most numerous
party this evening.'</p>

<p>Fiorello, in spite of the encouragement of Miss Betsey, repaired
to the rehearsal of the concert with much fear and anxiety. When
the time for its commencement arrived, the Baron, carrying his head
very erect, mounted the stage prepared for the solo players, and
without waiting to see if the others were ready, went to work in a
most pitiless manner upon the piece he had selected for his début.</p>

<p>It was a frightful charivari! But the musicians were paid to find
out great talent in their patron, and the applause he received, although
given with a degree of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">empressement</i> which might seem a little ironical,
made him the happiest of mortals. So far, all went on well;
but when, in the evening, the Baron saw among the invited guests
the brother of the king, an excellent violinist, and his cousin, the
Duchess of Cambridge, who had the reputation of being one of the
first musicians of the day, he was seized with an insurmountable
panic, and ran to find Fiorello. But the professor had departed
about noon, and his servant could not tell what had become of him.</p>

<p>'Come on then!' said the Baron; 'the die is cast! I must play,
cost what it will! I will at least, however, make use of the fiddle-stick
of my master, who, without the least regard for my reputation,
has abandoned me at this critical moment, in such a shameful
manner.'</p>

<p>The concert commenced with a magnificent chorus of Handel,
which brought forth immense applause. Then La Mengotti warbled
in a divine manner an air of Pæsiello, and was conducted back to
her seat in triumph. The order of the programme now designated
the solo of the Baron. Trembling from head to foot, he took his
place, and bowed profoundly to the august assemblage; while the
orchestra attacked the overture, which usually precedes those morceaus
which are designed to give eclat to a virtuoso. To the astonishment
of all present, the Baron executed the opening part of the
concerto with a vigor and precision that was marvellous. The
audience, who had come with the intent of laughing at their entertainer,
were lost in perfect amazement. But still greater was their
astonishment, when the Baron executed, with consummate taste and
skill, a delicious vitanello, which was set in the midst of the greatest
difficulties of his piece, like an odor-breathing violet in the midst of
a bunch of thorns. All arose with one accord; handkerchiefs waved
in the air; and the name of the Amphytrion of the entertainment
was mingled with the most hearty <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vivats</i>. The poor Baron experienced
a sensation that he had never before known; his limbs
trembled beneath him, and his forehead was covered with huge
drops of perspiration.</p>

<p>The next day, the valet-de-chambre of Baron Baygo, while arranging
the instruments which had been used at the concert, observed
that the hair of a valuable bow was covered with a thick coating of
candle-grease. Astonished at this phenomenon, he carried it to his
master, who, equally puzzled, sent for Fiorello, and holding up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
bow, said: 'Here, my dear master, is your fiddle-stick; it was of great
service to me last evening, I assure you; for without it I should not
to-day have carried my election as Speaker of the House. Leave
it with me as a token of remembrance, and accept this as a mark of
my esteem.' Thus saying, he slipped into the hand of Fiorello a draft
on his banker for a hundred pounds. 'But explain to me,' added
the Baron, 'how comes the hair of the bow in such a condition?'</p>

<p>Fiorello hung down his head, without replying. 'Oh, uncle!'
cried Miss Betsey, 'I will tell you all about it. Last night, during
the concert, Signor Fiorello was hid behind the screen; and it was
he who made all the beautiful music, while you were scraping the
fiddle so hard, with a fiddle-stick that made no noise!'</p>

<p>For a few moments, the Baron stood confounded. 'Marvellous
effect of self-love!' at length he exclaimed, for with all his foibles
he was at bottom a man of sense; 'so excited was I last evening,
that I really thought it was myself who executed those beautiful
pieces! But come, I must not quarrel with you, my dear Fiorello;
and I beg leave to double the amount of this draft, for the sake of
the stratagem, which has saved my reputation as a virtuoso. But I
see plainly that I must stop here, and play no more upon the violin,
lest this affair should get wind.'</p>

<p>The Baron kept his word; he gave up for ever his favorite instrument;
but in order to make himself amends, he diligently collected,
from time to time, all the different inflections of voice of the members
of the upper house; and a curious medley it was!</p>

<h2><a name="THE_EMPIRE_STATE_OF_NEW-YORK" id="THE_EMPIRE_STATE_OF_NEW-YORK">THE 'EMPIRE STATE' OF NEW-YORK.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BY AN ENGLISHMAN.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> above is but a significant title. New-York justly merits the
appellation of the 'Empire State.' Considered only as one of many
independent commonwealths linked together in a peaceful union,
what an idea must her grandeur convey of the American confederacy;
of the strength of the chain which binds together such
unwieldy masses, and renders the compact firm and enduring! It
is a harmony which, if it continues, will be more wonderful than
any save that of the spheres.</p>

<p>We enter into few statistics; we merely state the impressions of
an inhabitant of the Old World at taking a general survey of this
portion of the New; a glance at those great features which strike
the mind of the most casual observer. New-York possesses in
herself whatever would be necessary to constitute a great Empire,
if distinct and separate; cities, towns, villages, rivers, lakes, mountains,
soil, productions, and the most celebrated wonders in the world
of nature and art. In extent equal to Great-Britain, she is magnificent
in population, dominion, in developed and undeveloped
resources. Within her limits Nature has exhausted every element
of the beautiful or the sublime. The ocean thunders on her East,
and the Great Cataract upon her West. Erie and Ontario are two
great seas upon her borders, where the mariner may lose sight of
land; whose billows are equal to those of the ocean, in storms which
wreck the shipping destined for her provincial ports. The mighty
river St. Lawrence, with its thousand islands, separates her from the
British possessions on the North. On the North-east stretches Lake
Champlain, one hundred and twenty miles, with all its variety of
scene, from the low and swampy shore, to the boundary of steep
mountains close to the water's edge, or the cliffs where a hollow,
murmuring noise is heard when the breeze blows, from the waters
splashing in the crannies of the rocks. There are islands encompassed
with rocks, shores ornamented with hanging woods, and
mountains rising behind each other, range after range, with a magnificence
which cannot be described; but richer than all is she,
when she receives the waters of Horicon, the loveliest of lakes! It
embosoms two hundred islands, and is shadowed on either side by
high mountains, while its waves are of such delicious purity as to
reveal the slightest object which sparkles upon its bottom at any
depth.</p>

<p>New-York has within it the sublime mountain scenery of the
Kaätskills, where the eagle wheels over their hoary summits, and
the winds receive an edge which sometimes kills the flowers of May
in the valley. It has primeval forests where the axe has not sounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
and a few red men yet linger amid their gloom; and it has plains
which stretch themselves for miles, like the prairies of the far West.
It has solitudes where the foot of man has scarcely trod; and yet
for three hundred miles, from the Hudson to the great lakes, it has
city after city, town after town, village after village, in one unbroken
chain, rising like magic on the borders of lakes or in the heart of
vallies, where a few years since reigned the silence of nature; a
proud attestation of the superiority of the Saxon race. Situated in
a most favored zone, with skies hanging over it for the greatest
portion of the year unclouded as those of Italy, it enjoys the four
seasons, with their accompanying blessings, in equal distribution;
the spring with its gradual advances; the luxury of summer; the
autumn with its prodigal abundance; and that which enhances all
these, and is likewise full of sublimity, the snows of winter. Whoever
has sailed upon its rivers, or clambered its mountain-sides, or
descended into its vallies, or gazed upon its cataracts, but most of
all, has become acquainted with its works of art, must acknowledge
that this is preëminently the <span class="smcap">Empire State</span>.</p>

<p>But the Bay of New-York, rivalling the noblest in the world for
its depth, expansiveness, and beauty of its rising shores, is another
feature which deserves to be mentioned; and then we come to a
city, destined also to stand in the first class. Accustomed as I had
been to entertain an unpardonable prejudice and ignorance concerning
the New World, and almost to confound the name of American
with the red aborigines, it was with unfeigned surprise that I found
myself in such a city, stunned with the hum of her incessant bustle
and commerce, in the midst of somewhat fresh but stately buildings,
and mingling with the crowds in a thoroughfare, considering its
extent, one of the most magnificent in the world. Enthusiasm banished
every prejudice. I beheld on all sides the aspect of a luxurious
metropolis; well-furnished shops, churches, public buildings, and
private dwellings, which would have graced any city of Christendom.
Fountains in various parts were throwing up their waters to a great
height, and with profuse liberality. A river flowed through the
streets, brought from a distance of forty-five miles by an aqueduct,
in design and execution one of the most bold, stupendous works of
any age or country; yet some of my countrymen, who profess to
write books, have not even alluded to it.</p>

<p>Surrounded by so many wonders, I looked for something to remind
me of the past; to convince me that all this was not the work of
magic, or of a few years. I could not persuade myself that the
Indian ever rambled through the forests which covered the site of
this city, and that the canoe shot silently over the waters where I
beheld such a forest of masts. Just then, attracted by the sound of
music, and the eager looks of a crowd, I observed twelve Indians,
(among them were some handsome women) standing on a balcony
which fronted the main street of the city, wrapped in blankets, with
painted faces, and ornamented with a variety of gew-gaws. They
were Sioux, who had come on under the care of an agent, and were
exhibited as a show. The crowd gazed for a few moments, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
passed on with indifference: but it was a spectacle calculated to
plunge one into the most serious reverie. Here were the descendants
of the original possessors of the soil; the same class of men
whom Columbus described when he kissed the soil of which he
took possession; children of the same frailties, ornamented in the
same manner, the worshippers of the same spirit! Here was the
bustling Present; they were the representatives of the Past; the
poor children whose fathers once possessed this whole continent,
now gazed at, as if they were cannibals from the South Seas! As
they stood erect on the balcony, unconscious of the ardent gaze of
the crowd, dignified, silent, and unmoved, they seemed to me like
antique pictures hung upon a wall, in a garb and costume long since
obsolete. They carried with them their arrows and their tomahawks,
but these had long ago become powerless against the arts of civilized
man. They looked down upon the Saxons, and saw the race
which had destroyed their's. Around them the marble and the granite
were piled in stately buildings; the columns of Christian temples
rose before them, and the interminable streets of a great city. I
gazed again at the poor children of the forest, then at the accumulating
crowd, and all the evidence of power which I saw around;
and the juxtaposition appeared to illustrate most forcibly the forces
and resource of two races of men. The twelve Sioux on the balcony,
with their blankets, hatchets, and store of arrow-heads, were
to the physical strength and arts of the surrounding people what the
whole race of the red men is now to the race of the whites.</p>

<p>The greatness of the city of New-York, which is the metropolis
of the whole country, belies its provincial name, and its prosperity
attests its unrivalled position near the sea. According to the present
ratio of its increase, in less than twenty years it will number over
half a million of inhabitants, and in less than a century will attain
the rank which London now holds. The Old World pours in its
wealth perpetually, and it is the great centre and mart of commerce
for the New. Thither all the streams of commerce converge and
meet. The cold regions of the North, the cotton-growing South, the
great valley of the Mississippi, and beyond the Rocky mountains to
Astoria, the wild regions of the utmost West contribute to its wealth.
But passing by the feature of a great city, what a river has New-York!
I refer not to any of those which lie upon her borders, and
are shared by other states or nations, but to the <span class="smcap">Hudson</span>, which is
all her own. 'I thank <span class="smcap">God</span>,' wrote the elegant <span class="smcap">Irving</span>, soon after
his return to his native State, from a long residence abroad, 'I thank
<span class="smcap">God</span> that I was born on the banks of the Hudson! I fancy I can
trace much of what is good and pleasant in my own heterogeneous
compound, to my early companionship with this glorious river. In
the warmth of my youthful enthusiasm, I used to clothe it with
moral attributes, and almost to give it a soul. I admired its frank,
bold, honest character; its noble sincerity and perfect truth. Here
was no specious, smiling surface, covering the dangerous sand-bar
or perfidious rock; but a stream deep as it was broad, and bearing
with honorable faith the bark that trusted to its waves. I gloried in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
its simple, quiet, majestic, epic flow; ever straight-forward. Once
indeed, it turns aside for a moment, forced from its course by opposing
mountains, but it struggles bravely through them, and immediately
resumes its straight-forward march. 'Behold,' thought I, 'an
emblem of a good man's course through life; ever simple, open, and
direct; or if, overpowered by adverse circumstances, he deviate into
error, it is but momentary; he soon recovers his onward and honorable
career, and continues it to the end of his pilgrimage.' The
Hudson is, in a manner, my first and last love; and after all my
wanderings, and seeming infidelities, I return to it with a heart-felt
preference over all the other rivers in the world. I seem to catch
new life, as I bathe in its ample billows, and inhale the pure breezes
of its hills. It is true, the romance of youth is past, that once spread
illusions over every scene. I can no longer picture an Arcadia in
every green valley; nor a fairy land among the distant mountains;
nor a peerless beauty in every villa gleaming among the trees; but
though the illusions of youth have faded from the landscape, the
recollections of departed years and departed pleasures shed over it
the mellow charm of evening sunshine.'<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>We can add little to a picture like this, save the reiteration, that
the Hudson <em>is</em> one of the noblest rivers in volume, and that its
scenery is the grandest, of any river in the world. The Rhine,
through a part of its course, is dreary and uninteresting. The Mississippi
is incredible in its length: it rises amid the wintry snows,
and passes into the insupportable heats of summer, bearing to another
great city of the American union, fifteen hundred miles from New-York,
the immense wealth of its valley. It is the Father of Waters.
But its stream is always turbid; its shores flat and gloomy; its aspect
melancholy, yet suggestive of deep thought. But the Hudson rolls
brilliantly from where its thin streams rise in the mountains, until
it swells into a magnificent river, and bursts into that noble bay.
Here are no castles upon the beetling crags, associated with olden
story; or hoary ruins, every stone of which could tell a tale. Here
are no ivied turrets, or moss-grown walls, or battlements crowning
the rock; yet it lacks not, though it needs not, the charms of history
and associations of the past: it needs not the embellishments of
romance or pen of the poet; it is grand enough to fill the mind with
contemplations of itself. Follow its course in one of those princely
boats, miracles of architecture! three hundred feet in length, which
rush daily over its surface, swift as the lightning, yet more gracefully
than swans&mdash;the '<span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>'! Now it is wide enough for
whole navies to ride at anchor; and the distant shores look dim,
which afterward approach each other, and present the aspect of
gay meadows and cultivated fields. Now it rushes around mountainous
promontories, or cuts its passage through immense piles of
perpendicular rocks, which stand yawning on either side as if a giant
had torn them asunder to let the river pass through. Ossa is piled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
upon Pelion, Pelion upon Ossa; and from the grandeur or beauty of
the neighboring scene, the eye is directed by turns upon the waving
outline of distant mountains. They are like the ocean-color, 'darkly,
deeply, beautifully blue.' Sometimes the river becomes an expansive
bay; then a lovely lake shut in with hills; then a fair and even-flowing
stream. Memory can scarcely do justice to that splendid
variety of highland and lowland, precipice and verdant field, towns
and villages; and the swift boat makes all this one moving panorama.</p>

<p>Nor does the river abate in interest if you follow it two hundred
and fifty miles, where its origin is found in the little brooks and
delicious streamlets where the trout harbors, or among the thickets
where the frightened deer hastens to plunge into the lake. There
is a region in the northern part of the State, wild and uninhabited,
containing two hundred little lakes. There are to be found scenes
of indescribable beauty, to which only the pencil of the painter could
do justice; and yet there are few to tell him where to transport his
easel. Its pathless wilderness precludes also the huntsman; and
deer and an abundance of wild game are secure in the fastnesses
which have never been invaded by man. Yet is all this little, compared
with the dominions of the Empire State. The traveller who
directs his course westward from the Hudson to the great lakes, will
pause at every step to wonder at her variety of productions, her
endless resources, the magical growth of towns which have some
scores of thousands of inhabitants, and yet twenty years ago contained
only a few log-cabins of the hunters! The whole space is a
series of long, swelling undulations; uplands which slope away for
miles insensibly into rich-bottomed vallies, each one possessing its
broad, deep lake; and every one of these lakes is a perfect gem.
Otsego, Oneida, Skeneateles, Owasco, Cayuga, Seneca, and a score
of others are passed in succession; and on the shores of each the
lover of the picturesque might spend weeks with profit and delight.
With such a prodigality of waters, and especially in the vicinity of
the great lakes, the thunder-storms engendered by the summer heats
are of terrific grandeur. One would think that the dissolution of
nature was at hand. Some one has justly remarked that all things
here are on a large scale.</p>

<p>But the memories of the traveller are destined to be effaced,
when he hears for the first time the thunders of the Great Cataract,
and his eyes are turned to behold the cloud of spray which rises like
perpetual incense above its brink. From the sea-shore to Niagara
is now scarcely two days of easy travel. Not many years since, to
go thither, one was compelled to plod his way through a tangled
wilderness, trusting to uncertain pathways, in momentary fear of
wild beasts or wilder savages; and when he arrived at the place,
nothing but the rapture of the vision could enable him to forget the
perils of the journey, and the prospect of the return. One was
forced to pass by other sublimities of nature, which are now unseen
because they have disappeared; the gloom of forests and gigantic
trees, and the tumult of other cascades and waterfalls which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
avoided by a more direct route. The transition is most remarkable
from the heart of a great city, hundreds of miles distant, to the brink
of this stupendous precipice. The forests which used to intervene,
are reduced to separate clumps or groups of trees, which whirl round
on the verge of the horizon, and disappear, making the head giddy;
and one occasionally beholds the trunk or mummy of a gigantic oak
prostrate on the ground, preserving its ancient form and semblance,
but ashes to the core. This is where the pioneer has been; and
these are but the shadows of difficulties which once impeded the
traveller at every step.</p>

<p>Oh! the Rapids! the Rapids! It would atone for months of peril,
to know the exultation which arises from looking on that congregation
of billows! There they come, from the whole chain of lakes
and great inland seas, an incalculable host, plunging down a long
sloping hill-side, which is the bed of the wide Niagara river near the
chasm; storming the foundations of fast-anchored islands, and shattered
by the obstructions which they hurry with them, the fragments
of the convulsion which burst open the abyss where they leap!
They seemed to me infinitely more grand than the sea when it rolls
its huge breakers to the shore after a storm. Look onward, and the
prospect is alike infinite. The sky and the white crests of waves
form the boundary of vision, and seem as if they poured out of the
sky, so great is the descent; the waters gorging the wide stream,
and impeded at every step by rocks, and concealed caverns, whirl,
writhe, and <em>agonize</em>, with a violence of agitation of which it is in
vain to endeavor to convey an idea. It is the highest example of
wrath and strength in the elements, exerted without any cessation
or rest. The sea is upheaved mightily, but it is <em>sometimes</em> calm, and
reflects the clear sky. The volcano intermits its fiery grandeur.
The conflagration dies in ashes, where its little spark was first
kindled. The freshet, which is irresistible in its might, subsides in
violence, and permits the flowers to grow up again on the fertile
banks, and be imaged in the tranquil stream. The wildest hurricane
which bears upward the oak, abates into the musical winds. But
here the fury is unceasing; there is only an awful, unnatural calm
upon the brink of the precipice. And it is difficult to believe that
there is any thing yet behind the curtain, and that all this display of
waters, grand as it is, cannot convey the faintest idea of that which
remains, and is but the ushering in of a more glorious spectacle.</p>

<p>Think of the gentle river in the valley, with just current enough
to preserve its purity, and so visited by the winds that it would not
ruffle the swan's breast which reposes upon it so gracefully! Then
turn hither for contrast, and look in vain on this mad flood for a single
image of peace! Standing on the bridge which spans the American
cataract, and stretches to the islet which conducts you to Goat Island,
you look down and shudder. Nothing which breathes could be tortured
in that flood a moment, and live. Come then and look into
the abyss, and see the waters take the last plunge! And here
description ceases, for the simple reason that it would be all in vain.
With a grand sweeping arch, they roll forward over the ledge, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
calm and silent upon the brink, then dashed into atoms on the rocks
far below. The white smoke gushes up as from a hot furnace to
the sky! Oh what a cataract, and rocks, and river, whirlpools, and
awful chasms, solitude and yet communion with spirits, silence and
yet 'mighty thunderings!' I thought I had died, and was breathing
an immortal life in a new planet, where every surrounding object
was more vast and incomprehensible. I listened to a voice which
combines all sounds, yet chords with none in nature which it resembles;
not with the bass of ocean, not with the winter winds. It is
something which connects you palpably with the Past; a carrying
of the thoughts and imaginations far backward: like listening to the
blast of a trumpet prolonged by an angel from the beginning of time.
A storm burst tumultuously above the cataract. The long reverberations
of thunder would have terrified in another place; but here
they added nothing to the sublime. At last the sunshine, after a
little interval, broke out of the clouds, and rain-bows crowned the
glory of the scene, whose rich tints were perpetuated when the
moon arose. For here on the very spot, in the midst of the violent
element, where one might almost doubt the word of <span class="smcap">Deity</span> that he
would not again overwhelm the earth with water, among the manifestations
of His presence, sublimer than any but those on Sinai, he
has dissipated every doubt, and hung over the whole magnificent
scene his perpetual bow of promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I consider</span> the wines of France to bear the same rank in comparison
with those of other countries, that the highest order of
lyrical effusion sustains in the world of poetry. Ordinary Rhenish
wines are it's satires and pasquinades; Port is didactic verse; while
among the first growths of the Rheingau, of Madeira, and of
Spain, are to be sought the Shakspeares, the Homers, the Miltons,

<p>It is in conformity with this poetical disposition of things, that,

unloose the spirits of the mighty past, and restore in their happiest
temperament and condition, and to their bright and animated destiny,
the effulgent glories of the grape.</p>

<p>It was not always thus, dear John! 'I do assure thee,' as my
motto says, 'when time was,' a few cobweb'd bottles of old Madeira
upon the upper shelf of a chamber closet not too near the surface
of the earth, and a case or two, and basket or two, in a distant
receptacle, were, in the golden days of thy better manhood, but
faint precursors of thy rich and cherished hoards; thy vaulted cellar
and thy loaded wine-chamber&mdash;fraught as these now are with the
result of distant voyages, of curious tastings, of patient research,
and of elaborate choice illustrated with a benignant and happy
fortune. And yet those were glad days, bright days, precious days;
were they not? What a flavor, what a zest the wines wore when
thou and I were young! And the cookery! dear Sirs, how well-dressed
things were in those days!</p>

<p>We were living in a French boarding-house celebrated for it's
<i>cuisine</i>. Our wine of course depended upon our proper self, but I
have never met with a better <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table d'hôte</i> than we were wont to be
seated at, particularly upon any intimation to our worthy host that
we expected friends, and wished to entertain them with our best.
There was nothing of the 'busy hum of preparation,' nor any
anxiety about the successful practice of the cook, nor disappointment
in the marketing, nor rising in the dawn of morning after a
feverish night to acquire, at any cost, the first specimen of the
season; nothing of that state of perturbed feeling which a tourist
among us well calls 'stirring Heaven and Earth to give a dinner;'
but the hour came, the guests were punctual, and we sat down with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
young hearts, young spirits, and above all, young palates to the
board.</p>

<p>Among those few cobweb'd bottles that I have adverted to, upon
that upper shelf, in that chamber closet, of that upper story, there
might in those days have been discerned one that stood, like a star,
<span class="smcap">APART</span>; the treasured, cherished, garnered bottle that should upon
some <i>alba dies</i> occasion grace our bachelor's repast. It was twin
bottle to one that had been opened for us in that City of Refuge of
good wines, Charleston South Carolina, in those days not less
certainly than now, the abode of the hospitable, the accomplished
and the brave. Our host there had produced its fellow as a specimen
that he was desirous his friends should appreciate. 'Oh Stephano,
hast any more of this?'</p>

<p>When I arrived in New-York after <em>ten</em> days and <em>ten</em> nights of
continuous posting, (the distance is now accomplished I am told
cleverly in <em>three</em>,) the flavour of that wine still regaled my
palate; there was a spiritual vineyard flourishing within my
heart; the fragrant blossom, the young grape, the purple cluster,
the yielding pressure, and the nectareous juice; the autumnal grape-leaf
with its magic dyes, and all the long history of joy which it is
given to one or two rare specimens of the wines of this life to
impart to the spirit of man; to impress upon his nerves; and to be
recalled in sensations that make glad the fountains of his heart, and
dispense his affections among his fellow men; all these were
present to my senses, and delighted me with a varied, an intellectual,
and constantly reviving joy. I had never known so perfect a
beverage; and I wrote at once to my friend, offering him in
exchange any description of wine that he could name to me, bottle
for bottle.</p>

<p>He returned for answer an expression of regret that one only
bottle remained of the batch; and intreating my acceptance of
what I prized so highly, sent it on without delay. This was that
lonely bottle, that stood, in vague and uncertain light like a Hero of
Ossian, upon that upper shelf, in that chamber closet, of that upper
story. Often did I gaze upon it, often apostrophize it, praise it with
a recollected gladness, remember its acquirement, delight in its
possession, and wonder when the time might come, and when the
friends, that should deserve the peerless, the incomparable offering.</p>

<p>Upon a certain memorable day, and punctual to the moment,
came a chosen party of my most honored and distinguished friends.
The dinner was beyond praise, and all the appointments good. No
crowd, no tumult, no excuse, no delay in serving, no vacant seat, no
chair with small open hexagons of split rattan to disfigure the person
of the guest for three successive days when the dress is thin,
or to torture him when the weather is cold with pains which he is
ashamed to complain of or even to mention&mdash;&mdash;a practice,
Mr. Editor and all who hear me, still obtaining in some houses in
New-York, and at times, especially in winter, more abhorrent to
the thoughts than is the martyrdom of St. Lawrence, since heat
upon a gridiron is in many of its appliances preferable to cold upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
sharp rattan. No; each guest had his cushioned chair, 'with
ample room and verge enough;' and course after course, and wine
after wine, appeared, and was enjoyed, discussed, and quietly disappeared,
alike without want or waste.</p>

<p>Well, the time of the repast came for my selected wines: they
were all prepared, and all in the finest order and condition. The
series was a perfect one; a veritable ladder of transport; up which
the spirits of my guests ascended gracefully, step after step, as each
higher and higher flavour presented itself to their gratified and
entranced palate. At the last, sole remaining bottle of the list,
came my Charleston acquisition. It is certainly in bad taste to
expatiate upon one's wine from the chair, but as this was the only
bottle of it's kind in the world, it seemed necessary to introduce it
with a word that should at least perform that ceremony.</p>

<p>I told the story of its acquisition, and expressed the pleasure it
gave me to present on this occasion the one remaining bottle of the
world. We had been conversing a moment or two before, I remember,
on the comparative advantages in drinking wine, between the
<em>sip</em> and the <em>throw</em>, and had come to the conclusion, (which I think
every man of sense must ultimately arrive at,) that the latter is the
true way to enjoy the full <em>aroma</em> of the beverage, and at once to
gain that gratifying descent, and that ascent to the wits; in short
that satisfying blessedness of taste, which the mere sipper of potations
of whatever kind must vainly aspire to know; say what you
may to the contrary, Mr. T. G.!</p>

<p>The bottle was uncorked, decanted, and the wine came forth, in
the profound silence and expectation of the guests, bright as the
beam of your mistress's eye! The attention of all present was so
absorbed by their interest in this only bottle, that until every man's
glass was filled, hardly a sound was perceptible except the gurgling
of the long-necked decanter as it distributed its glorious contents
and passed with wings from hand to hand around the board and
returned drained to the head of the table. Toasts were at that time
in vogue; and as soon as I had said, '<i>Our hospitable friend in South
Carolina, may his own last bottle reward him for the pleasure of this
gift</i>,' each man did ample justice to the wine.</p>

<p>How shall I recount the catastrophe that ensued! We are all
sinful men born to trouble as the sparks fly upward, and it seemed
as if the wine had also dealt ample and instant justice upon us!
Every soul present was struck through the heart and liver to the
spine! All rose instantly from the table, speechless, aghast, and
terrified with the effect! There was a napkin or handkerchief over
the mouth of each, and if we could have articulated a word, we
might have exclaimed with the sons of the prophets at the feast in
Gilgal, 'Oh my Lord, there is death in the pot!'</p>

<p>But it was impossible to relieve ourselves by words; it was literally
in tears and groans that the guests made for the door, vanished
from the room, escaped from the house, and left me, appalled,
transfixed, incapable of utterance, standing at the head of my
deserted table, and feeling that 'No man said, 'God bless him!''</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>For a fortnight, three weeks, a month, no one of my guests had
his mouth <em>right</em>! I was afraid to walk in the streets lest I should
meet one of them; there was a paralytic stricture in the countenance
of each member of that sad party; in some it wore an
expostulatory, an admonitory, in some a remonstrant, and in all the
look of <em>a much injured person</em>. I must except one gentleman whom
however I did not get a glimpse of until six weeks had elapsed.
He was a well-bred Frenchman, with all the suavity and grace of
manner that belongs to his class and nation. I shall ever feel
grateful to him for the first kind word I had received since the discomfiture;
though I have sometimes had doubts, judging from the
reïnstated appearance of his lips, whether he had taken more than
half a glass: 'My dear Sir,' said he, 'when I had the pleasure to dine
with you at your very agreeable party, there was one wine that
had flavour very exemplary, ma foi!' I acknowledge it, I said. 'I
think you did say it was American wine?' I did, I replied. 'What
is the name if you please, as I pay much attention to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sujet</i> of
wines?' I named it. 'Will you be so very kind as write it in my
tablet?' I prepared to comply; and telling him that I was not
quite certain of the correct orthography of the word, wrote in large
characters, the word, '<span class="smcap">Scuppernong</span>.'</p>

<h2><a name="THE_QUOD_CORRESPONDENCE" id="THE_QUOD_CORRESPONDENCE">THE QUOD CORRESPONDENCE.</a></h2>

<p class="center oldenglish b12">Harry Harson.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER FIFTEENTH.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">More</span> than a week had elapsed since the rupture between Rhoneland
and Rust; and during that period Jacob neither saw him nor
heard from him. But in that interval he had become confirmed in
his purpose of resistance; and had resolved, come what might, to
risk any thing, rather than submit to the mental bondage which had
hitherto crushed him. Steadfast in this purpose, he quietly awaited
the movements of his adversary.</p>

<p>On one fine afternoon, the bright rays of a setting sun streaming
through the window fell upon the face of the old man, as he was
dozing in his room, and awakened him. Starting to his feet, and
casting his eyes hurriedly about him, he exclaimed; 'I tell you no;
I tell you <em>no</em>, Michael Rust. It shall never be! Ah Kate!' said
he, looking about the room, and seeing no one except his daughter,
'it's you, is it?&mdash;only you? And I've been dreaming? Well, well;
thank God it was no worse! It's strange I should have dreamed
that Michael Rust wanted you, Kate, and asked for you. But no
matter; kiss me, child. We've done with him. There's a comfort
in that. We shall be quite happy&mdash;happy as we once were. Shall
we not, Kate?'</p>

<p>Kate's lips quivered, as she pressed them to his forehead; and
there was a busy little voice at her heart, which whispered a name,
and brought up recollections that nearly choked her, as she said, in
a low tone, 'Quite happy.'</p>

<p>'But Kate,' said her father, placing an arm about her waist, while
he put back her hair with his other hand, and looked anxiously in
her face, 'you don't say happy, <em>as in old times</em>.'</p>

<p>Kate was silent. What could she say, when her young heart was
breaking? But at last she <em>did</em> say:</p>

<p>'It certainly will make me happier, much happier, than I have
been, to know that you are once more yourself; that that evil, daring
man has lost his influence over you, never to regain it; and that
there is nothing to harrass you and break you down, as there once
was. All this makes me quite happy. Indeed it does!' But there
was that in her tone which belied her words, and Rhoneland observed
it.</p>

<p>'Ah! child, child!' said he, shaking his head sorrowfully. 'I see
it all. Ned Somers has much to answer for. I loved and trusted
him. God forgive him that he meditated so vile a wrong! He was
to me as my own son. Had he loved you, Kate, openly and honorably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
as a man should, and as you deserve to be loved, and had he
asked you from me, I would not have said <em>no</em>, Kate. But he acted
like a villain; and I've cast him off forever.'</p>

<p>Kate became very pale, and her voice grew thick and husky, as
she asked: 'Father, will you answer me a question?'</p>

<p>'Yes Kate, a hundred,' said he, drawing her more closely to him.
'I'll sit here all day long, and answer you. Now that <em>he</em> is gone, I
feel quite young and boyish again; and nothing gladdens me more
than your voice. Now go on. What is it?'</p>

<p>The girl took his hand in both her's, and looking steadily in his
face, asked: 'Who told you the tale which set you against Ned?'</p>

<p>'Who?' inquired Rhoneland; 'who? Why, he&mdash;Rust.'</p>

<p>'And have you never found, in the course of your dealings with
that man, that he could forget or pervert the truth; or even invent a
falsehood, when it served his own purpose?'</p>

<p>Jacob Rhoneland laughed to himself, in a low chuckling tone, and
rubbed his hands. 'What, lie?&mdash;Rust lie? Bless you, child, he
does that more than any thing else. Ha! ha! He's a deep one,
depend on it.'</p>

<p>'And can you see no reason for his traducing Ned?' said she, the
blood mounting to her face, as she spoke. 'Was there no plan
of his, which Ned's presence here crossed, and which rendered it
necessary to prejudice you against him?'</p>

<p>The old man pondered; looked at her, and then at the floor; and
at last sank back in his chair, in a deep and unpleasant reverie;
from which he was only aroused by a knock at the door. 'Go to
your room, Kate. It's Enoch. I'll open the door myself.'</p>

<p>Kate had scarcely left the room, and Jacob had not yet risen to
obey the summons, when the door of the apartment opened, and
Michael Rust walked in, as quietly and serenely as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>'Good evening, friend Jacob,' said he, bowing low, and speaking
in his softest tone. 'I'm here again, you see. I could not give you
up so soon. I could not let a trifling misunderstanding break off old
friendship. I had'nt the heart to do it, good Jacob. There was a
severe struggle between pride and friendship, but friendship gained
the day; and I have come with an open heart to offer you my most
humble apology, and to ask you to forget and forgive. I feel that I
took an unwarrantable liberty with Kate; but I loved her, Jacob,
and was hurried too far by my feelings. I was wrong, and you
acted as a father should. Let us forget the past, and be as we
were.'</p>

<p>Michael stretched out his hand, as he spoke, and even held it so,
for some moments; but Rhoneland neither took it, nor looked at it,
nor at him, nor uttered a word in reply; but with both hands resting
on the top of his cane, which he had taken to assist him in rising,
and his chin on them, sat looking out of the window, as if there
were no other person than himself in the wide world.</p>

<p>What was it that bowed the bold, bad man, who had never yielded
to him before?&mdash;who had trodden on his very neck, mocking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
sufferings, jeering at his agony of mind; returning threats for supplications,
and revilement for tears; and now brought him a suppliant
to his feet? Was it that strange, mysterious feeling which sometimes
tells a man that the hour of his fate is approaching, and that
his time is measured? Was the coming storm flinging its shadow
over his path, even before the bursting of the tempest? Did he feel
the earth sinking beneath his feet; and was he glad to grasp, even
at a decayed and shattered branch to hold him up? Or was it a part
of a deeper policy; and was there yet something to be gained by
clinging to his former dupe? It may have been a mixture of all
these feelings; but certain it is, that there he was; the same thin,
bowing, cringing hypocrite, with a tongue of oil and a heart of flint,
endeavoring by soothing words and fawning lies once more to win
back the man who had turned his back upon him. And equally
certain it is, that a more unyielding, impenetrable, imperturbable
piece of humanity he had never met with; for to all his fine sentences,
allurements, and artifices of every kind, he received no
reply.</p>

<p>'This tack won't do,' thought Rust. 'He won't swallow honey.
I'll give him wormwood; but before that, one more attempt.'</p>

<p>'Jacob, my friend,' said he, drawing a chair nearer to him, seating
himself, and sinking his voice; 'perhaps you think I meant ill
about your daughter?'</p>

<p>The old man moved restlessly, but was silent. Rust saw that he
had touched the theme which would arouse him.</p>

<p>'You were mistaken, my friend. Would that the intentions of all
were as pure as mine.'</p>

<p>'Speak of something else,' replied Rhoneland, abruptly. 'I'll not
hear you on that subject.'</p>

<p>'But you must,' said Rust; 'indeed you must, my old friend. Not
that I would annoy you; but I came here for that express purpose;
and <em>must</em> speak of her.'</p>

<p>Rhoneland looked keenly at him, and then at the floor, grasping
the sides of the chair firmly; as if to restrain himself from violence,
and Rust went on.</p>

<p>'I'm a man of few words, Jacob. Kate's a dear, sweet girl. I
love her; she loves me. Will you give her to me for a wife?'</p>

<p>'It's false!' said Rhoneland, starting to his feet. 'If there be a
single person in this world whom Kate hates more than another, it
is you! Give her to <em>you</em> for a wife!' exclaimed he, in a bitter tone;
'give <em>her</em> to <em>you</em>&mdash;<span class="smcap">YOU!</span> I'd see her in her coffin first! Go, Michael
Rust,' said he, extending his hands toward him; 'your power is at
an end in this house. Go!'</p>

<p>'Not quite, good Jacob!' said Rust, in a low, fierce tone. 'Not
<em>quite</em>, good Jacob! I know what your plans are; what your hopes
are. I know what Enoch Grosket can do; and in what he'll fail.
He'll fail to vindicate Jacob Rhoneland. He'll fail to vindicate
himself. He'll fail to overthrow Michael Rust. He and Jacob will
soon be cheek by jowl with those whose good deeds have placed
fetters on them. It's well, Jacob, it's well. We'll see who'll win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the race. Pause, good Jacob, pause before you decide. I give you
five minutes. With Michael Rust for a son-in-law, you are safe.'</p>

<p>Rhoneland grew exceedingly pale; and then summoning his resolution,
said:</p>

<p>'I <em>have</em> decided. Though it cost me my life, you shall not marry
Kate. Go!'</p>

<p>'Jacob Rhoneland, one word.'</p>

<p>'Not a syllable!' said the old man, grasping his heavy cane, and
his face becoming purple with anger: 'viper! begone! If you
darken my doors one moment longer, I'll fling you into the street!'</p>

<p>'Good-by, Jacob,' said Rust; but not another word did he utter,
as he left the house. His face was ashy pale; his features pinched
and sharp; and he gnawed his lip until the blood came from it.
Regardless of his appearance; with his long locks hanging in tangled
flakes about his face, he hurried on. Dead and corpse-like as
his features were, never was a fiercer spirit at work, to give life and
energy to human frame; never was there a stronger concentration
of dark passions in a human heart. His pace was quick and firm;
there was no loitering; no pausing at corners, to think; no sign of
irresolution. Darting along the street where the old man lived, and
striking into one of the wider cross-streets of the city, he followed
it until it brought him into Broadway. This he crossed, and plunged
into that labyrinth of narrow streets which run between that and the
Bowery. Threading them, with the ready step of one familiar with
their turns and windings, he neither paused to inquire his direction,
nor to read the sign-boards; but even in the darkest and dreariest
corners, his knowledge seemed certain and accurate. The twilight
had darkened into night, and the streets were narrow; and as he
proceeded in the direction of the more fated parts of the city, dim
figures, which like bats were shrouded in holes and dark hiding-places
in the day time, were beginning to flit about, yet he felt no
hesitation nor fear. In the most gloomy and blighted of all these
places, he paused, cast a quick suspicious glance about him, to see
that none watched him, and then darted up an alley between two
houses, so ruined and sagged that their gables met over it like a
gothic arch. Groping his way along, he came to a door at the foot
of a flight of stairs which terminated the passage. He did not pause
to knock; but pulling a string, opened it, and ascended a pitch-dark
staircase, which in like manner was terminated at the upper end by
a door. At this he knocked loudly. He was answered by a gruff
voice which inquired:</p>

<p>'Is that you, Joe?'</p>

<p>'No,' replied Rust.</p>

<p>'Well, if you ain't Joe, who are you? If you ain't got a name,
peg away; for blow me, if I open till I hear it.'</p>

<p>There was a noise, as if the speaker, in conclusion of his observation,
drew a chair or bench along the floor, and seated himself.</p>

<p>'Come Bill,' said another voice, 'this won't do. You'd better
open it.'</p>

<p>A muttering from Bill showed that he thought otherwise; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
person who had spoken, apparently not heeding his disapprobation,
got up and opened the door, giving to Rust as he did so a full view
of the interior of the room.</p>

<p>At a table sat a man with coarse red hair, and a beard of several
days' growth. He was a brawny fellow, six feet high, with a cast
in one eye, which seemed to have been injured by a deep gash; the
scar of which still remained, commencing on the very eye-lid, crossing
one cheek, and his nose, and giving an air of sternness to features
which needed not this addition, to express much that was bad. His
companion, who had opened the door, was a man of smaller build,
with broad, square shoulders, dark sharp eyes, narrow forehead, and
overhanging brows, and a thin, tremulous lip; and though possessed
of less physical strength than his comrade, looked much the most
dangerous man of the two.</p>

<p>They both eyed Rust for a moment, without speaking, and then
the larger of the two said to his comrade: 'Tim Craig, hand the
gentleman a chair.'</p>

<p>'I don't want one,' said Rust abruptly. 'Have you seen Enoch?'</p>

<p>They both shook their heads.</p>

<p>'He'll blow on me, and you, and others.'</p>

<p>The two men looked at him, and then at each other, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>'He's set himself up against me&mdash;<em>me</em>!' said Rust, his thin lip
curling and yet trembling as he spoke.</p>

<p>'He's a dark man, that Enoch,' said Craig, in a low tone. 'There's
no good in crossing him, Mr. Rust.'</p>

<p>'Crossing him! crossing <em>him</em>!' exclaimed Rust. 'He has crossed
<em>me</em>. Who ever did <em>that</em>, and prospered! Ho! ho! Enoch, Enoch!
you mistook your man!'</p>

<p>The two looked anxiously at each other, but did not speak; and
although they had the thews and sinews which could have torn the
thin form before them to shreds, it seemed as if they both shrank
from him with something like fear.</p>

<p>'It has come to the death-struggle between us,' said Rust; 'one
or the other must fall.'</p>

<p>'If you're the one?' inquired Craig.</p>

<p>'Others must go too,' replied Rust; 'they <em>must</em>.'</p>

<p>Craig gnawed his lip.</p>

<p>'If Enoch goes, he goes alone,' continued Rust. 'He must be out
of my way; he knows too much.'</p>

<p>The men exchanged looks; but the larger of the two seemed to
leave all the speaking to the other, merely listening with great attention,
and occasionally favoring his comrade with a glance, whenever
it seemed necessary.</p>

<p>'I have no time to stay now,' said Rust, turning to Craig: 'I've
told you enough. Grosket is in my way. I must be rid of him.'</p>

<p>Craig put his finger to his throat, and deliberately drew it across
it. 'You're a ticklish man to deal with, Mr. Rust. Is that what
you mean?' said he.</p>

<p>'I say I must be rid of him,' replied Rust, fiercely. 'Are you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
deaf? Are your brains addled? Rid of him&mdash;<em>rid</em> of him&mdash;<span class="smcap">RID</span> of
him!' exclaimed he, advancing, and hissing the words in the man's
ear, while there was something in his look and manner that caused
even the bold villain he addressed to draw back and assume a somewhat
defensive attitude. 'Do you understand me now? Law won't
do what I want. I prescribe no mode; but Enoch Grosket must be
out of my path.'</p>

<p>'You're growing red-hot, my master,' said the man, bluntly. 'But
I must have what you want spoken out. Shall he be knocked on
the head?'</p>

<p>'Hasn't he committed a murder, burnt a house, stolen, embezzled?
I think I've heard of his having done something of the
kind,' said Rust, earnestly.</p>

<p>'Of course he has. He's done 'em all, if you like. Bill knows
something about them. Don't you, Bill?'</p>

<p>'Oh! yes,' said Bill, refreshing himself from a large pitcher of
water. 'This 'ere vorter is very weak. Blowed if I ain't forgot
what liquor smells like; and it's so long since I see'd a dollar, that
bless me, if I think I'd know one. I'd have to go to some obligin'
friend to ax what it was.'</p>

<p>This declaration of ignorance was accompanied by a look of consummate
disgust into the pitcher, and another of a very peculiar
character at Rust.</p>

<p>That worthy, however, seemed not unused to meeting with gentlemen
in similar trying circumstances; for he gave both the look
and language an interpretation which, considering the enigmatical
mode in which they were expressed, fully met the views of the man
who uttered them; and thrusting his hand in his pocket, he drew
out a handful of silver, which he flung into the pitcher, and said:</p>

<p>'Perhaps that will improve the water.'</p>

<p>Bill made no other response than a broad grin; and then said in
a more business-like tone:</p>

<p>'Well, about that murder, and house burnin', and all that. What
do you want?'</p>

<p>'I want proof of it against Grosket, if he did it.'</p>

<p>'In course he did it,' replied the man, with a knowing look.</p>

<p>'Well, bring me the proof of it, and bring it soon. You know
where to find me.'</p>

<p>He turned on his heel, and even before they were aware that he
had left the room, he was on his way through the street.</p>

<p>His course was now to his old den. When he reached it, he
found even that paragon of clerks, Mr. Kornicker, absent. This was
a relief; for he was too much excited to care to have any witness of
his appearance.</p>

<p>'It struck seven as I passed the town-clock,' said he. 'It wants
an hour to the time fixed. I'll wait.'</p>

<p>Although it was dark, he flung himself on a chair, without striking
a light, and sat for some time in silence, tapping the floor with his
foot. But rest was not the thing for his present mood; and he soon
started up, and paced the room, muttering to himself. At last the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
clock struck eight. The lights, which shining from the windows in
different parts of the building, somewhat relieved the gloom of his
room, were extinguished one by one, and it became pitchy dark.
Rust lighted a candle; placed it on the mantel-piece, and stood
looking at it for some moments. He heard a step on the stairs; but
it ascended to the floor beyond, then descended, and went out in the
street. He looked at his watch; it was but five minutes after eight.
'God! how slow the time went!' Perhaps his watch had stopped.
He put it to his ear: tick, tick, tick! There seemed an interval of
a minute between every stroke. 'Five minutes past eight; ten
minutes more, and <em>she</em> will be here,' muttered he; 'and then I shall
know the worst.'</p>

<p>He put the watch in his pocket; and looking at the ceiling,
attempted to whistle; but it would not do. His blood was in a
fever. Hark!&mdash;was that a footstep on the stairs? No, it was only
the tread of a person overhead. Hist! what's that? He stood
stock-still, and listened. There was a slight shuffling noise in the
passage; and then a faint tap at the door.</p>

<p>Rust sprang forward, and opened it. A female, muffled in an old
cloak, stood cowering on the outside.</p>

<p>'Ha! it's you at last!' exclaimed he, in that abrupt, energetic
manner, which suited his character better than his more usual tones.
'What news?'</p>

<p>The woman, either to gain time, or because she was really exhausted,
staggered to a chair, and turning her face to the light,
revealed the features of Mrs. Blossom.</p>

<p>'Ah's me! ah's me!' said she, leaning back, and sighing heavily.
'It's a wearisome way I've come, old and feeble as I am&mdash;old and
feeble, old and feeble&mdash;a very wearisome way.'</p>

<p>There must have been something in the look of Rust, who stood
before her with his black, glowing eye fixed on her's, that was peculiarly
startling; for she paused in her whining, and turning to him,
said:</p>

<p>'What do you look at me so for?'</p>

<p>'Is there no reason for it?' said Rust, in a low voice. 'Is there
no trust betrayed? Have you done all that you swore to do?'</p>

<p>Mrs. Blossom, hardened as she naturally was, and as she had
become, by long following a pursuit which requires no little assurance,
was not without some signs of trepidation at this question.</p>

<p>'No, no; I haven't. I swear I haven't,' said she.</p>

<p>'I placed two children in your charge,' continued Rust, in the
same low tone. 'They were never to leave it, except for one
place&mdash;the grave.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Blossom's wan features grew paler, as she whispered: 'Not
so loud, Mr. Rust, not so loud.'</p>

<p>'As you please; I'll whisper,' said Rust, suiting the action to the
word; and speaking in a whisper, yet so distinct and thrilling, that
each word seemed to come like a blow. 'I placed two children
under your charge; and unless I required them, and unless they
grew ill, and died, they were to become what you are. Where are
they? I want them.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Blossom looked hopelessly about her, as if she meditated an
escape; but seeing no chance of any, she cast a deprecating eye at
Rust, shook her head, and said nothing. Rust went on in the same
strain:</p>

<p>'They were with you two months since; going on gloriously;
travelling at a hand-gallop to the grave. I have heard strange
stories of them since. Are they true?'</p>

<p>Still the woman was silent.</p>

<p>'Answer me!' said Rust, his fury gradually getting the mastery
of him, and his voice bursting out loud and clear. 'Where are they?'</p>

<p>Mrs. Blossom clasped her hands and looked at him, but uttered
not a word.</p>

<p>'Where are the children? Answer me!' said he, starting to his
feet, and darting up to her, his eyes perfectly blood-shot with fury,
and the foam standing round his lips; 'the children, I say&mdash;<em>the
children</em>! <span class="smcap">God</span> d&mdash;n you!&mdash;do you hear me?'</p>

<p>Mrs. Blossom cowered down in the chair, and made one or two
futile efforts to speak; her thin blue lips quivered; but no sound
came from them; while a kind of idiotic smile fixed itself on her
features.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The children</span>, I say!' exclaimed Rust, gnashing his teeth with
rage; and seizing the woman by the shoulders in his paroxysm of
fury, he shook her until she reeled and fell to the floor. 'What
have you done with them? Answer me; or by the God of Heaven
I'll crush you beneath my feet!'</p>

<p>Before his amiable intention, however, could be carried into effect,
Mrs. Blossom had recovered her wits, her feet, and not a little of
her usual spirit; and turning upon him, with eyes flashing as brightly
as his own, she said:</p>

<p>'They're gone, Michael Rust; gone, <em>gone</em>! Do you hear that?
Gone, where when you next see them you will wish the undertaker
had measured them before. Gone, gone! ha! ha! You won't see
the lambs again. So much for striking an unprotected female,
Michael Rust. That for ye! <em>that</em> for ye! <span class="smcap">THAT</span> for ye!' And she
snapped her fingers in the face of the disappointed schemer, and left
the room, slamming the door loudly after her.</p>

<p>Rust clasped his hands, as she went out, and raised his eyes to
heaven.</p>

<p>'Gone!' repeated he, in a low tone; '<em>gone!</em>&mdash;both gone! And
I&mdash;I?&mdash;what will become of me? Is it for <em>this</em> that I have toiled
and slaved for years; that I have stooped to meanness and dissimulation;
have steeped myself in crime, and have had felons and
miscreants of every dye for my associates? For years have I been
on the rack: no more quiet hours, or peaceful dreams; no more love
from those of the same blood; but cursed, hated; hated with the
worst hate, the hate of one's own kindred; my schemes thwarted,
my hopes blighted; a felon; my dearest hopes crumbled to dust;
these two children restored to their rights; Kate married!&mdash;and I, <em>I</em>,
where shall I be? God of Heaven!' exclaimed he, dashing up and
down the room, 'shall these things be? <em>Shall</em> I fall?&mdash;shall <em>they</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
triumph? Never! never! Be yourself, Michael Rust!' said he,
in a choked voice; 'be yourself! be yourself! This has happened
from trusting others. Rely on yourself, Michael; be cool, Michael;
and then thwart them&mdash;thwart them!'</p>

<p>He paused and stood in the middle of that room like a statue.
Slowly and by degrees every trace of excitement disappeared from
his features, until they had assumed a sharp, rigid, fixed look; and
then, he said, pursuing the same theme: 'Thwart them; <em>thwart</em>
them, Michael Rust! Work, toil, cringe, lie, steal, murder&mdash;aye,
do <em>any</em> thing&mdash;but thwart them, thwart them! Good Michael Rust,
don't suffer yourself to be a by-word in their mouths! And if you
fail, Michael, die fighting. There's something noble in <em>that</em>. Be it
so; be it so!' said he, in a stern, abrupt tone. 'They've driven me
to extremities. Nothing but desperate measures can save me.
Desperate measures shall be tried. Does success require a life?
Well, well; the world's overloaded; it shall have one. If I attain
it, it will be another's; if I fail, it will be my own: the grave is a
quiet resting-place; a better one than the world, when a man's
foiled in all his aims. But I'm weary, I'm weary!' said he, in a
low, desponding tone; 'my head's dizzy, and my brain confused, by
the troubles which have come so thickly upon me to-day. I must
rest.'</p>

<p>Drawing a chair to the table, he seated himself upon it; bent his
head down upon the table, and exhausted by the excitement of the
last few days, which had taxed even his iron frame beyond its
powers of endurance, he soon slept heavily.</p>

<p class="center">WRITTEN IN TEN MINUTES.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A lady</span> one day said to the celebrated Count <span class="smcap">Rostoptchin</span> that
he ought to write his memoirs. The next day the Count handed
her a little roll of paper. 'What have you here?' asked the lady.
'I have obeyed your commands,' replied he; 'I have written my
memoirs; here they are.' The lady was not a little surprised at the
promptness of the performance; and hastened to peruse the following
morceau, the caustic wit and piquancy of which will remind the
reader of the keen satire of Voltaire.</p>


<h3>MY MEMOIRS, OR MYSELF AS I AM.</h3>

EPISTLE.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER I: MY BIRTH.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the twelfth day of March, 1765, I emerged from darkness into
the light of day. I was measured, I was weighed, I was baptised.
I was born without knowing wherefore, and my parents thanked
heaven without knowing for what.</p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER II: MY EDUCATION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> taught all sorts of things, and learned all kinds of languages.
By dint of impudence and quackery, I sometimes passed for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i>.
My head has become a library of odd volumes, of which I keep the
key.</p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER III: MY SUFFERINGS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> tormented by masters; by tailors who made tight dresses
for me; by women, by ambition, by self-love, by useless regrets, by
kings, and by remembrances.</p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER IV: PRIVATIONS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> been deprived of the three great enjoyments of the human
species; theft, gluttony, and pride.</p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER V: MEMORABLE EPOCHS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the age of thirty, I gave up dancing; at forty, my endeavors to
please the fair sex; at fifty, my regard of public opinion; at sixty,
the trouble of thinking; and I have now become a true sage, or
egotist, which is the same thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER VI: MORAL TRAITS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> stubborn as a mule, capricious as a coquette, frolicksome
as a child, lazy as a dormouse, active as Bonaparte, and all at my
pleasure.</p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER VII: IMPORTANT RESOLUTION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> having been able to master my countenance, I let loose
the bridle of my tongue, and contracted the bad habit of thinking
aloud. This procured me some pleasures and many enemies.</p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER VIII: WHAT I WAS AND WHAT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> been very sensible of friendship and confidence; and if I
had been born in the golden age, I might perhaps have been a very
excellent man.</p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER IX: RESPECTABLE PRINCIPLES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> never meddled in any marriages or scandal. I have never
recommended a cook or a physician; and consequently have never
attempted the life of any one.</p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER X: MY TASTES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I took</span> pleasure in small parties, and was fond of a walk in the
woods. I had an involuntary veneration for the sun, and his setting
often made me sad. Of colors I preferred blue; in eating, beef with
horse-radish; for drinking, cold water; at the theatre, comedy and
farce; of men and women, open and expressive countenances.
Hunchbacks of both sexes always had a peculiar charm for me,
which I could never define.</p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER XI: MY DISLIKES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> a dislike to sots and fops, and to intriguing women who
make a game of virtue; a disgust for affectation; pity for made-up
men and painted women; an aversion to rats, liquors, metaphysics,
and rhubarb; and a terror of justice and wild beasts.</p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER XII: ANALYSIS OF MY LIFE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I await</span> death without fear and without impatience. My life has
been a bad melo-drama on a grand stage, where I have played the
hero, the tyrant, the lover, the nobleman, but never the valet.</p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER XIII: THE BOUNTIES OF HEAVEN.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> great happiness consists in being independent of the three
individuals who govern Europe. As I am sufficiently rich, meddle
not with politics, and care very little for music, of course I have
nothing to do with Rothschild, Metternich, or Rossini.</p>


<p class="center"><br />CHAPTER XIV: MY EPITAPH.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Here</span> lies, in hope of repose, an old deceased devil, with a worn-out
spirit, an exhausted heart, and a used-up body. Ladies and
Gentlemen, pass on!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><br />DEDICATORY EPISTLE TO THE PUBLIC.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog</span> of a Public! discordant organ of the passions! thou who
raisest thy minion to heaven, and then plungest him in the mire;
thou who extollest and slanderest without knowing why; image of
the tocsin; echo of thyself; absurd tyrant; offscouring of the meanest
houses; extract of the most subtle poisons and of the most
exquisite perfumes; representative of the devil among the human
species; a fury masked in Christian charity!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Public!</span> whom I
feared in my youth, respected in my riper years, and despised in my
old age; it is to thee that I dedicate my memoirs. Gentle Public!
I am at last out of thy reach, for I am dead, and consequently deaf,
blind, and mute. Mayest thou enjoy these advantages for thy own
repose and for that of the human race!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> read in the '<cite>Bibliographie Universelle et Portative des Contemporains</cite>'
that 'when Count Rostoptchin visited Paris, people were
not a little surprised to find a man of wit and good breeding in one
whom until now they had regarded as a 'ferocious Tartar.' This
brutal epithet was no more suitable to a man like Count Rostoptchin
than that of 'an incendiary,' with which Madame d'Abrantes has
honored him in her memoirs. A great many piquant sayings are
attributed to him, of which we will merely quote the following:
'I came to France,' said he, 'to judge for myself of the real merit of
three celebrated men; the Duke of Otranto, Prince Talleyrand, and
Potier.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> It is only the last who seems to me to come up to his
reputation.'</p>

<p>Here is another piquant anecdote. One day when the Emperor
Paul I. was surrounded by a numerous circle, among whom were
many Russian princes, and count Rostoptchin, his favorite minister,
'Tell me,' abruptly asked he of the latter, 'why are you not a
prince?'</p>

<p>After a moment's hesitation at this singular question, Count Rostoptchin
replied:</p>

<p>'Will your Imperial Majesty permit me to give the true reason?'</p>

<p>'Undoubtedly.' 'It is because my ancestor, who came from
Tartary to settle in Russia, arrived there in the winter time.'</p>

<p>'Ah! and what had the season of the year to do with the title that
was given him?'</p>

<p>'This, your Majesty; when a Tartar-lord made his first appearance
at court, it was the custom for the sovereign to give him the
choice between a fur-cloak and the title of prince. My ancestor
arrived during a very severe winter, and had the good sense to
prefer the former.'</p>

<p>Paul laughed heartily at this reply; and turning to the princes
who were present: 'See, gentlemen,' said he; 'you may congratulate
yourselves that your ancestors did not arrive in the winter!'</p>

<h2><a name="INTERNATIONAL_COPY-RIGHT" id="INTERNATIONAL_COPY-RIGHT">INTERNATIONAL COPY-RIGHT.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Crispin</span>, who stole leather to make shoes for the poor, was none
the less a thief, says Wolfgang Menzel, in an article on literary
piracy. But Menzel is a German, and it would be alike absurd and
unsafe for an eminently practical people, like ourselves, to be governed
in regard to our national policy by an eminently philosophical
people like the Germans. We are by no means certain that Crispin
is not a fellow to be copied: before we pronounce judgment upon
him, we must know whether he stole from his own countrymen, or
from foreigners. There is a vast difference; a difference as great
as the countries may be apart. Nothing can be more evident than
the proposition that a nation cannot exist by domestic thievery, for I
cannot steal from my neighbor unless my neighbor steal from abroad.
Therefore, in considering a theft, nationally, it is of the first importance
to know who it is that has been robbed. Like many other
acute critics, Menzel has furnished a very potent argument to refute
his own doctrines, by reasoning a little too close: the parallel between
the shoe-maker who steals his leather for the benefit of the
people, and the printer or book-publisher who pirates the contents
of a book, is a peculiarly unhappy one for the cause he advocates.
Nothing can be more evident, no principle is more strongly interwoven
in our policy as a nation, than that of encouraging domestic
manufactures. It is very plain that if the material for our books cost
us nothing, we can manufacture them more cheaply than a rival
nation that is compelled to pay their authors for producing them; it
is also equally evident that they can therefore be afforded at a
cheaper rate to the people, and that the quantity sold will be in proportion
to the lowness of the price, and that the intelligence of the
people will be in proportion to the number of books that are read:
if, in addition to the contents of our books, we could pirate the leather,
paper, types, and ink of which they are composed, we should be the
most enlightened and independent people in the world, if we are
not so already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>The trade of authorship has always entailed on its professors
poverty and disease. The sedentary habits which it induces must of
necessity undermine health: the abstraction from the every-day
affairs of life, requisite to its successful prosecution, almost always
causes insanity, or at least mania; and it is not clear that monomania
is not an essential feature of authorship: in fact, the history of
authorship is but a record of wretchedness. No other profession
has furnished an exclusive chapter of calamities. We never hear
of the calamities of merchants, of brick-layers, or cultivators. If
then we can save our countrymen from the exercise of a calling so
manifestly injurious to their happiness and welfare, by availing ourselves
of the labors of foreigners, to whom we owe neither protection
nor fealty, what man who wishes well to his country will have the
temerity to oppose a practice so conducive to our national prosperity?
We have declared ourselves a free and independent people; but
could it be said that we were either free or independent, if we were
restrained, by self-imposed laws, from making free with the labors
of a rival nation, separated from us by an ocean of three thousand
miles? or independent, if we were dependent upon ourselves for
our intellectual pabulum?</p>

<p>The only independent nation of modern times was the Algerines,
now unhappily extinct. They were a model people! They were
free and independent, in the most liberal and extended sense. They
were dependent upon themselves for nothing which they could take
from other nations; and so fully did they carry out their principle of
national independence, that they looked to a foreign power to furnish
them with their governors. No native of the soil was ever harrassed
by the cares of government. All their rulers were imported
from abroad.</p>

<p>In respect of mere corporeal rulers, we are as yet far behind the
Algerines, but virtually we are in advance of them as respects our
governing power. No one will deny that to rule the mind is far
better, more honorable, more arduous, and more important, than to
rule the body. Our mental rulers are all foreigners; the majority of
them pensioners of a government that advocates and inculcates
principles directly opposed to those that we profess. They rule us
by means of the books that we cunningly pirate from them, and
thereby save ourselves a very great amount of trouble and expense.
It is true that some of our people are mad enough to attempt to
divide this ruling power with these foreigners, by publishing books
themselves; but their efforts only prove the correctness of our assertion;
for in order to smuggle their works into notice, they are compelled
to make them so nearly like those that are printed, that they
could not be distinguished from them, were it not for their title-pages.
Evidences of these truths abound, on all sides, as well in the Church
as the State. Some of our young preachers have improved their
opportunities of studying foreign books to that degree, that they have
boldly confessed that the great reformation was not only unjustifiable,
but a real detriment to the cause of humanity. Others have professed
a faith in the fine old conservative doctrine of the divine right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
of kings; and one young presbyter that we know, has quitted his
country, and now officiates as a chaplain in the dominions of her
most gracious majesty, Victoria the First. Other blessings equal to
these are continually manifested by our rulers and legislators, who
give abundant evidence that they have profited by the continual
influx of foreign mind. One great statesman, of the Virginia school
of politics, a great patriot and a great orator also, profited to such an
extent by his foreign books, that he could not even read a work that
had been re-printed in this country. But we would not be thought
to advocate so sublime and patriotic an extension of the great principle
of pirating as this, because it would deprive our artisans and
tradesmen of a very profitable business. Perhaps the most remarkable
and beneficial effect of our independence of ourselves, is manifested
by the clergy, who depend almost entirely upon England for
their theology, and thereby become so thoroughly imbued with an
independent spirit, that when they happen to be troubled with a
thoracic disorder, or any other disease, immediately leave their flocks
to the care of the great Head of the Church, and hurry off to Europe
to consult foreign physicians, and inhale a mouthful of foreign air.</p>

<p>But the real benefits of the present system of pirating English
books, consist in the employment given to capital and labor. Our
paper-mills, type-founders, printers, binders, and book-sellers, are
kept in constant employment by the intellect of Great Britain. The
brain of Walter Scott alone gave employment to a greater number
of mechanics and tradesmen than that of any American since the
revolution, with the exception of Fulton. It must be borne in mind
that the imagination of a foreign author creates for us a source of
employment, which but for him would not exist; beside furnishing
for us a never-failing source of recreation and profitable enjoyment.
Were it not for Scott and Bulwer, Boz and James, we should have no
novels to read; were it not for Tom Moore, we should have no songs
to sing; and but for foreign composers, we should have no music.
Since the successful experiment of ocean navigation, we have
become more and more independent of ourselves; and we now have
the gratification of seeing London newspapers hawked about our
streets, to the very manifest falling off in the manufacture of the
home article. If we still remain true to ourselves, and resolutely
shut our ears to the complaints of these interested and mercenary
writers, both at home and abroad, the time will soon come when our
people will be saved entirely from all literary drudgery, and even
our newspapers be re-publications of London Times' and Chronicles,
as some of our Magazines already are of London and Edinburgh
and Dublin monthlies.</p>

<p>How absurd, how impudent, how mercenary and grovelling, it is
in these British authors to require of us to pass a law that will
deprive ourselves of such great advantages, merely to put a few
dollars in their pockets, and encourage a set of men among us to
supplant them, and so inculcate a spirit of base and servile self-dependence
among our people! The great object of an author
should be fame. No true genius will exert himself for filthy lucre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
It must be infinitely more grateful to a high nature to be read by
thousands, than to be paid by hundreds; and therefore we benefit
these foreigners in spite of themselves, by re-printing their works at
a cheap rate, thereby greatly enlarging the circle of their readers,
and adding to their reputation. It is very true that the British Parliament
has passed a law giving to American authors the privilege
of copyright as soon as a reciprocal law shall be passed by us; but
are we to be dictated to by the British Parliament? Are we to be
reminded of our duty by foreigners, who thus make a show of their
magnanimity, only to entice us to follow their example? Shall we
become mere copyists of another nation? Forbid it Justice! forbid
it Independence!</p>

<p>If we concede to the foreign author a right of property in the productions
of his brain, which after all is merely the distillation of other
people's ideas expressed in some other way before him, or at best
the promptings of Nature, which are the common property of mankind,
like air and sun-shine, we shall next be called upon to
recognize the inherent and indestructible right of an author to his
works, for all time.</p>

<p>When a citizen purchases of government a quarter section of land
in one of the territories, and pays for it at the rate of a dollar and a
quarter the acre, it becomes his own property, and the whole nation
would rise up like one man to defend him in the undisturbed possession
of it to the end of time. But if this same citizen should
devote the flower of his manhood, the vigor of his intellect, and even
the land itself which he may have purchased of his country, in the
production of a book for the benefit of humanity, he would have no
right to the possession of his work but for a very limited number of
years; and although he would be protected in the possession of his
land, or the products of it, from foreign aggression, we would not
allow him any protection in the enjoyment of the product of his brain,
even though a foreign nation should civilly agree to respect our law
for that purpose if we should think proper to pass one.</p>

<p>The reasons for these distinctions in regard to different kinds of
property are so very clear and conclusive, so exceedingly simple and
obvious, that we do not choose to insult the understanding of our
readers by repeating them. Some of the advocates of an international
copy-right have urged in its favor that a measure so just could
not be otherwise than politic, and that it would be safe to adopt one,
without any regard to expediency, but relying solely upon truth and
justness. But such a principle as this is directly at variance with
the genius of our constitution and laws; and were it adopted in one
case would be urged as a precedent in another, and an entire overthrow
of our system of government would be the consequence.
Were so mischievous a principle as this once adopted by our legislators
as their rule of action, what would become of those noble
specimens of eloquence with which we are favored every session of
Congress, when members who are perfectly agreed as to the justness
of a measure, dispute for weeks and months in regard to its expediency
or profit? What would become of our army and navy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
our corps of diplomatists? What would become of many of the
peculiar institutions of the North and of the South? In short, how
would our representatives contrive to lengthen out a session, or even
make a speech for <i>Bunkum</i>, to be read by their constituents?</p>

<p>The subject widens as we write; absurdities throng around our
quill, striving to get down to the nib of our pen; and the very fulness
of the argument chokes our utterance; we grow fustigatory and impatient
to lay about us; but we must conclude in the words with which
an ingenious cotemporary a few months since began an essay upon
the same subject, namely: '<i>Copy-right is a humbug</i>.'</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MAIL_ROBBER" id="THE_MAIL_ROBBER">THE MAIL ROBBER.</a></h2>

<p class="center">NUMBER FOUR.</p>

<p class="center">TO THE EDITOR OF THE KNICKERBOCKER MAGAZINE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I can only account for your conduct by this one supposition:
you must be a <em>drinking-man</em>. Nothing but the repeated, though
perhaps unconscious, inebriation arising from an excessive use of
stimulating drinks, could produce that torpidity of the moral sentiments
which is manifested by your editorial career. Your late allusion
to the cordwainers of Xeres, or in vulgar tap-room slang,
'<em>sherry cobblers</em>,' is very strong against you. Your ill-timed merriment&mdash;the
jocose levity of your 'Editor's Table'&mdash;all go to confirm
my theory. You indulge&mdash;I know you do.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, as a strict Washingtonian, and the corresponding secretary
of two temperance societies, I request you for the benefit of
the community to make a statement of your case, with a phrenological
chart of your developments, a brief account of your habit of
body, your temperament, age, etcetera, together with the amount
which you absorb daily, and a history of your propensity. In the
anticipation of such a statement, I forego any offence at whatever
may formerly have passed between us. You are to be pitied rather
than detested. I know, from experience, that under the influence
of stimulants we are not always accountable agents. We should
be merciful one to another; and although I have heretofore found
it difficult to repress my disgust at your folly, I assure you that
I am far from entertaining unchristian feelings. May you yet
live to become a respectable member of society, and an ornament
of our ranks! You may find worthier employment in conducting
some religious journal or temperance periodical. If you become
sincerely anxious to reform, and to distinguish yourself as an ardent
champion of virtue, the society will feel pleasure in lending you
their powerful aid. Our funds are at present somewhat low, in consequence
of the prodigious expense of a late fair and several temperance
pic-nics in the country, at which we nobly burned many
whole hogsheads of the most costly Jamaica and Cogniac spirits.
The sight of the self-destroying monster wasting away in the blue
intensity of his own suicidal flame, excelled any thing in the way
of moral grandeur that I have witnessed since the Croton-aqueduct
celebration. Still, in spite of our tremendous disbursements, I will
venture to promise you, if you enlist under the banners of the cause,
a handsome situation, either as a Reformed Inebriate, or a travelling
County-Delegation Jubilee Pic-Nic Poet and Orator. Depend upon
it, that under the cold-water system your profits will be increased,
your morals improved, your appetite and intellectual faculties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
enlarged and well-balanced, and all the fibres of the frame restored
to a firm, vigorous tone.</p>

<p>Touching the subject of these letters, I would observe that our
English friend has done very wisely in permitting their publication.
But surely you will not think of accepting his favors without giving
him an adequate requital. I am told they are extensively read, and
add much to the attractions of your Magazine. He certainly ought
to be most handsomely paid. Having never thought it worth while
to make any poetry myself, I cannot well judge of the labor of
making it, or of its value; but I know that we have repeatedly paid
clergymen in New-England thirty or forty dollars for a temperance
ode, and hymn to match. For my own part, I am willing to sink
my demand (albeit a prior one) in favor of his own claim. He will
consider the propriety of either going on shares with me, or allowing
me whatever premium he may think just upon each letter. Instrumental
as I have been in preserving his epistles from the dangers
of flood and fire, and procuring their secure transmission, through
the pages of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>, to their destination, he will not
neglect my hint. I am willing to look upon it as merely a commission
business; my object being rather an amicable arrangement,
and a mutual understanding of each other's interests, than any thing
of a mercenary nature. Whatever profit may fall to my hands shall
all be faithfully devoted to the Cause.</p>

<p>I send you herewith a splendid pictorial illustration, colored to
the life, of the awful appearance of the interior of a drunkard's
stomach. It has produced a powerful sensation in Boston, and may
persuade you to reflect upon the possible condition of your own
intestines.</p>

<p>I beg that you will by no means print this letter, as it may look
like trumpeting my own goodness.</p>

<p class="sig">
Yours, etc., in the Pledge,
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> the foregoing injunction of the pacified financier
not to print his letter, it is evident that he intended it for the
public eye. It would moreover be most unjust not to let the world
into a knowledge of his many virtues. As to our own vices, and
especially the one here dwelt upon with so much fervor, we must be
permitted to remark, in reply to the commiseration and advice of our
moral friend, that during the whole course of a life 'now some years
wasted,' we were never 'groggy,' 'intoxicated,' 'boozy,' 'swipsed,'
'cut,' 'how-came-you-so,' 'swizzled,' or 'tight,' but <em>once</em>; and
assuredly <em>that</em>, as <span class="smcap">Dogberry</span> says, 'shall be <em>suffegance</em>.' On a certain
evening of one of the remote 'days that were' in our history,
we remember ('ah! yes! too well remember!') trying to discover
whether there was any foundation for the suspicion of a friend, that
we had been over-'indulging' at a supper-party from which we both
were returning. The fact truly was so. We ascertained, in endeavoring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
for the satisfaction of our friend, to 'toe a mark' in the pavé,
that the side-walk invariably followed the lifted foot; and that when
we essayed to set its fellow down, the pavement receded in such a
terrific manner that the sole encountered it with a good deal more
of emphasis than discretion. We recollect, too, that the key-hole
of our bachelor's-apartment was found to have been stolen on that
memorable evening, rendering our key nugatory, adscititious, of no
account, and so forth; and that when, by the aid of a fellow-lodger,
we had achieved our room and bed, we found the latter emphatically
a 'sick' one, and at times during the night in a very 'sinking
condition;' so much so indeed, that at one period we began to 'despair
of its <em>recovery</em>.' But that one abuse of Nature, (who always
revenges herself, and at once, upon her assailants,) taught us a lesson
which we have never forgotten, and never shall, 'unto thylke
day i' the which we crepe into our sepulchre.' For the rest, we
certainly <em>do</em> affect an occasional glass of <em>good</em> wine at a cheerful
board, with congenial guests; such wine as we are informed, on the
<em>best</em> authority, 'maketh glad the heart of man;' such as Saint <span class="smcap">Paul</span>
recommended to his brethren 'for their stomach's sake;' a wine, in
short, which 'creates a spiritual vineyard in the heart,' and 'dispenses
one's affections among his fellow men.'</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Annals and Occurrences of New-York City and State in the Olden Time. By John
F. Watson, Esq. New-York: Baker and Crane.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> is a new work touching the <span class="smcap">Knickerbockers</span>, which <em>we</em> are especially bound
to notice; and this we do with the more satisfaction, that we can heartily commend it to
the notice of our readers, or what is the same thing, to 'the public at large.' We perceive
by a few pages of the work which have been laid before us, that this is an enlargement
of a former edition, favorably known to the reading public, entitled '<cite>Historic Tales
of Olden Time concerning New-York</cite>.' It now notices the rise and progress of the inland
country and towns, relates much concerning the pioneer settlers, and details the hostilities
and ravages of their Indian neighbors. It is in fact a complete history of a buried
age; and brings up to the imagination, for its contemplation and entertainment, a picture
of 'things as they were in the days of rustic simplicity, so wholly unlike the present
display of fashion, pomp, and splendor.' It is easy to perceive that Mr. <span class="smcap">Watson</span> gathers
facts and writes <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</i>; not for profit, in this book-making age, but because he feels
and sees our wonderfully rapid advancement from small things to great. 'I have written,'
he says, 'for New-York and State; not for money, but for patriotism. I felt it due
to the country, to tell its tale of wonder; and due to <span class="smcap">God</span>, for His gracious and signal
providence, in so settling and prospering our Anglo-Saxon race, in this new field of His
exercise.' To quote the warm language of one of our contemporaries: 'This is in truth
a work without example for its imitation; and with equal truth, it is in execution a work
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>. It is a museum that will never cease to attract. Its annals and statistics
will have snatched from oblivion valuable reminiscences of the early youth of our
country; and will furnish the historian, biographer, and the patriotic orator with matter
to adorn and beautify their productions. He deserves the gratitude of his country, and
the patronage of the reading community. Wherefore, no American that can read and
can afford to purchase, should be without a copy of this valuable contribution to the
memoirs of early American history.' We venture to predict that the aged will be delighted
to be thus reminded of things which they have heard of, or perhaps witnessed; and the
young will be surprised to find such a lively picture of the doings of their forefathers.
Among the many subjects considered, are the first settlements and primitive incidents
connected with New-York, Albany, Schenectady, Rochester, Brooklyn, etc.; notices of
the early Dutch times; manners and customs; dress, furniture, and equipage; local
changes; ancient memorials, and curious facts. Much is said of the Indians; of the
local incidents connected with the revolutionary war; of ancient edifices and buildings;
in short, of every thing calculated to bring back scenes and occurrences of by-gone
times. These matters too are related in a style peculiar to the author; they are matters
moreover only to have been perceived and scanned by a mind so constituted as his own.
The work is undertaken by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Baker and Crane</span>, a young and enterprising metropolitan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
house, and will be completed in one octavo volume of about five hundred pages;
illustrated with thirty new pictorial embellishments; and furnished to subscribers at the
low rate of two dollars per copy, payable on delivery. Among the engravings, which
are to be executed in the best manner on wood, will be two views of New-York City;
one of New-Amsterdam in 1659, one of New-Orange in 1673; a map of the city, as it
appeared in 1729; pictures of the old Federal Hall, in 1789; the Walton and Provost
Houses; Trinity church, now numbered in the catalogue of things that have been; the
Merchants' Exchange, destroyed by the 'great fire' of '35; beside numerous other edifices,
of interest to the antiquary; and also views of <span class="smcap">Hudson's</span> arrival at Sandy-Hook;
the Erie Canal, Niagara Falls, the Conflagration of Schenectady, etc., etc.; and 'last,
though not least,' a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fac simile</i> of the head and signature of the good old governor,
renowned in <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker's</span> annals as '<span class="smcap">Peter</span> the Headstrong,' or '<span class="smcap">Hard-Kopping
Piet</span>.' 'Finally, brethren,' let every <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span> who feels an affectionate attachment
to the home of <em>his</em> fathers, or veneration for the memory of <em>their</em> fathers, secure at
once for himself a knowledge of all manner of curious things inseparable from our history,
from one who has been called 'the <span class="smcap">Homer</span> of his class, and in archeology, peerless.'
Subscription-lists are open at the office of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>, at the store of
the publishers, number 158 Pearl-street, and at the rooms of the Mercantile Library
Association.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the dedication of this volume, the writer alludes to its being 'deeply tinged with
romance and mysticism;' but to our conception, its pages exhibit a far greater amount
of <em>truth</em>, undeniable, and of deep import to society at large, and to our own metropolitan
community especially. Here is a woman who knows 'how to observe;' and we cannot
do a better service to thousands in our city, who walk its streets and thoroughfares, and
visit the hundred-and-one places of resort in its vicinity, without appreciating or enjoying
the objects of interest or instruction by which they are surrounded, than to call their
attention to the records of the volume under notice. And having done this, we shall
proceed to illustrate the reason for the faith that is in us that they will thank us for this
recommendation, by presenting a few desultory extracts. Let us commence them with
a remarkable case of instinctive knowledge in birds, related by the writer's grandfather,
who saw the fact with his own eyes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">He</span> was attracted to the door, one summer day, by a troubled twittering, indicating distress
and terror. A bird, who had built her nest in a tree near the door, was flying back and forth with
the utmost speed, uttering wailing cries as she went. He was at first at a loss to account for her
strange movements; but they were soon explained by the sight of a snake slowly winding up the
tree. Animal magnetism was then unheard of; and whosoever had dared to mention it, would
doubtless have been hung on Witch's Hill, without benefit of clergy. Nevertheless, marvellous
and altogether unaccountable stories had been told of the snake's power to charm birds. The
popular belief was, that the serpent charmed the bird by <em>looking steadily at it; and that such a sympathy
was thereby established, that if the snake were struck, the bird felt the blow, and writhed under it</em>.</p>

<p>'These traditions excited my grandfather's curiosity to watch the progress of things; but, being
a humane man, he resolved to kill the snake before he had a chance to despoil the nest. The
distressed mother meanwhile continued her rapid movements and troubled cries; and he soon
discovered that she went and came continually, with something in her bill, from one particular
tree&mdash;a white ash. The snake wound his way up; but the instant his head came near the nest,
his folds relaxed, and he fell to the ground, rigid and apparently lifeless. My grandfather made
sure of his death by cutting off his head, and then mounted the tree to examine into the mystery.
The snug little nest was filled with eggs, and covered with leaves of the white-ash! That little
bird knew, if my readers do not, that contact with the white-ash is deadly to a snake. This is no
idle superstition, but a veritable fact in natural history. The Indians are aware of it, and twist
garlands of white-ash leaves about their ankles, as a protection against rattlesnakes. Slaves
often take the same precaution when they travel through swamps and forests, guided by the north
star; or to the cabin of some poor white man, who teaches them to read and write by the light of
pine splinters, and receives his pay in 'massa's' corn or tobacco.</p>

<p>'I have never heard any explanation of the effect produced by the white-ash; but I know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
settlers in the wilderness like to have these trees round their log-houses, being convinced that no
snake will voluntarily come near them. When touched with the boughs, they are said to grow
suddenly rigid, with strong convulsions; after a while they slowly recover, but seem sickly for
some time.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is a charming sketch of an actual occurrence, which goes far to confirm the
writer's impression 'that instinct is founded on traditions handed down among animals
from generation to generation, and is therefore a matter of education:'</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Two</span> barn-swallows came into our wood-shed in the spring time. Their busy, earnest twitterings
led me at once to suspect that they were looking out a building-spot; but as a carpenter's
bench was under the window, and frequent hammering, sawing, and planing were going on, I had
little hope that they would choose a location under our roof. To my surprise, however, they soon
began to build in the crotch of a beam, over the open door-way. I was delighted, and spent more
time watching them than 'penny-wise' people would have approved. It was, in fact, a beautiful
little drama of domestic love. The mother-bird was <em>so</em> busy, and <em>so</em> important; and her mate
was <em>so</em> attentive! Never did any newly-married couple take more satisfaction with their first
nicely-arranged drawer of baby-clothes, than these did in fashioning their little woven cradle.
The father-bird scarcely ever left the side of the nest. There he was, all day long, twittering in
tones that were most obviously the outpourings of love. Sometimes he would bring in a straw,
or a hair, to be inwoven in the precious little fabric. One day my attention was arrested by a
very unusual twittering, and I saw him circling round with a large downy feather in his bill. He
bent over the unfinished nest, and offered it to his mate with the most graceful and loving air
imaginable; and when she put up her mouth to take it, he poured forth <em>such</em> a gush of gladsome
sound! It seemed as if pride and affection had swelled his heart, till it was almost too big for his
little bosom. The whole transaction was the prettiest piece of fond coquetry, on both sides, that
it was ever my good luck to witness.</p>

<p>'It was evident that the father-bird had formed correct opinions on 'the woman question;' for
during the process of incubation he volunteered to perform his share of household duty. Three or
four times a day would he, with coaxing twitterings, persuade his patient mate to fly abroad for
food; and the moment she left the eggs, he would take the maternal station, and give a loud alarm
whenever cat or dog came about the premises. He certainly performed the office with far less
ease and grace than she did; it was something in the style of an old bachelor tending a babe; but
nevertheless it showed that his heart was kind, and his principles correct, concerning division of
labor. When the young ones came forth, he pursued the same equalizing policy, and brought at
least half the food for his greedy little family. But when they become old enough to fly, the veriest
misanthrope would have laughed to watch their man&oelig;uvres! Such chirping and twittering!
Such diving down from the nest, and flying up again! Such wheeling round in circles, talking
to the young ones all the while! Such clinging to the sides of the shed with their sharp claws, to
show the timid little fledgelings that there was no need of falling!</p>

<p>'For three days all this was carried on with increasing activity. It was obviously an infant
flying-school. But all their talking and fuss were of no avail. The little downy things looked
down, and then looked up, and alarmed at the infinity of space, sank back into the nest again.
At length the parents grew impatient, and summoned their neighbors. As I was picking up chips
one day, I found my head encircled with a swarm of swallows. They flew up to the nest, and
chatted away to the young ones; they clung to the walls, looking back to tell how the thing was
done; they dived, and wheeled, and balanced, and floated, in a manner perfectly beautiful to
behold.</p>

<p>'The pupils were evidently much excited. They jumped up on the edge of the nest, and twittered,
and shook their feathers, and waved their wings; and then hopped back again, saying, 'It's
pretty sport, but we can't do it!' Three times the neighbors came in and repeated their graceful
lessons. The third time, two of the young birds gave a sudden plunge downward, and then fluttered
and hopped, till they alighted on a small upright log. And oh! such praises as were warbled
by the whole troop! The air was filled with their joy! Some were flying round, swift as a ray
of light; others were perched on the hoe-handle, and the teeth of the rake; multitudes clung to
the wall, after the fashion of their pretty kind; and two were swinging, in most graceful style, on
a pendant hoop. Never, while memory lasts, shall I forget that swallow-party! I have frolicked
with blessed Nature much and often; but this, above all her gambols, spoke into my inmost heart,
like the glad voices of little children. That beautiful family continued to be our playmates until
the falling leaves gave token of approaching winter. For some time, the little ones came home regularly
to their nest at night. I was ever on the watch to welcome them, and count that none were
missing. A sculptor might have taken a lesson in his art from those little creatures, perched so
gracefully on the edge of their clay-built cradle, fast asleep, with heads hidden under their folded
wings. Their familiarity was wonderful. If I hung my gown on a nail, I found a little swallow
perched on the sleeve. If I took a nap in the afternoon, my waking eyes were greeted by a swallow
on the bed-post; in the summer twilight they flew about the sitting-room in search of flies,
and sometimes lighted on chairs and tables. I almost thought they knew how much I loved them.
But at last they flew away to more genial skies, with a whole troop of relations and neighbors.
It was a deep pain to me, that I should never know them from other swallows, and that they
would have no recollection of me.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Child</span> has a remarkable power of <em>adaptation</em> in her style. Her similes are often
exceedingly forcible and felicitous. Observe the admirable comparison which closes the
ensuing passage, descriptive of the services at the Synagogue of the Jews, on the Festival
of the New-Year:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">While</span> they were chanting an earnest prayer for the coming of the Promised One, who was to
restore the scattered tribes, I turned over the leaves, and by a singular coincidence my eye rested
on these words: 'Abraham said, See ye not the splended light now shining on Mount Moriah?
And they answered, <em>Nothing but caverns do we see</em>.' I thought of Jesus, and the whole pageant
became more spectral than ever; so strangely vague and shadowy, that I felt as if under the influence
of magic. The significant sentence reminded me of a German friend, who shared his sleeping
apartment with another gentleman, and both were in the habit of waking very early in the
morning. One night, his companion rose much earlier than he intended; and perceiving his
mistake, placed a lighted lamp in the chimney corner, that its glare might not disturb the sleeper,
leaned his back against the fire-place, and began to read. Sometime after, the German rose, left
him reading, and walked forth into the morning twilight. When he returned, the sun was shining
high up in the heavens; but his companion, unconscious of the change, was still reading by lamp-light
in the chimney corner. And this the Jews are now doing, as well as a very large proportion
of Christians.'</p></blockquote>

<p>And in this allusion to the tyranny of public opinion, there is an important truth very
adroitly enforced by an apposite anecdote, timely remembered:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Few</span> men ask concerning right and wrong of their <em>own</em> hearts. Few listen to the oracle <em>within</em>,
which can only be heard in the stillness. The merchant seeks his moral standard on 'change&mdash;a
fitting name for a thing so fluctuating; the sectary in the opinion of his small theological department;
the politician in the tumultuous echo of his party; the worldling in the buzz of saloons.
In a word, each man inquires of <em>his</em> public; what wonder, then, that the answers are selfish as
trading interest, blind as local prejudice, and various as human whim? A German drawing-master
once told me of a lad who wished to sketch landscapes from nature. The teacher told
him that the first object was to choose some <em>fixed point of view</em>. The sagacious pupil chose a cow
grazing beneath the trees. Of course, his <em>fixed point</em> soon began to move hither and thither, as
she was attracted by the sweetness of the pasturage; and the lines of his drawing fell into strange
confusion. This is a correct type of those who choose public opinion for their moral fixed point of
view. It moves according to the provender before it, and they who trust to it have but a whirling
and distorted landscape. Coleridge defines public opinion as 'the average prejudices of the community.'
Wo unto those who have no safer guide of principle and practice than this 'average of
prejudices!''</p></blockquote>

<p>Doubtless a vast number of persons as fervently desire the time when 'wars shall
cease from under the whole heaven,' as our author. Like herself, thousands feel that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Too long at clash of arms amid her bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pools of blood, the earth has stood aghast:'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">but she will find few who will carry the prejudice which a hatred of war has created in
her bosom so far as she has done. On visiting what was once the grave of <span class="smcap">Andre</span>, she
is shown by the guide the head-quarters of General <span class="smcap">Washington</span>: 'I turned my back
suddenly upon it. The last place on earth where I would wish to think of <span class="smcap">Washington</span>
is at the grave of <span class="smcap">Andre</span>.' And she adds, that she never could look upon <span class="smcap">Andre's</span>
execution 'as other than <em>a cool, deliberate murder</em>!' The stern necessity which impelled
the <span class="smcap">Father of his Country</span> to this act, at which his great heart, throbbing with the cares
of an infant empire, melted in pity, is termed 'a selfish jealousy, dignified with the name
of patriotism!' All this, however, is creditable to the <em>woman's-heart</em> of our author; as is
her wish, and the 'strong faith' of which it is the father, that the time is not distant
when 'all <em>prisons</em> will cease from the face of the earth.' Human nature, howbeit, must
undergo an important change before such an event can take place; and a long time
must elapse before <span class="smcap">Washington's</span> memory can receive any injury from attacks upon it
like the one above cited. We are getting, however, to the end of our tether, in the 'short
commons' left for us in this department; but after the written and 'illustrated' praise
which we have awarded to the volume before us, we are compelled, in candor, to add a
word or two of censure. Now and then, it must be admitted, our author is slightly vague
and <em>bizarre</em>, as if to make good the declaration in her dedication; and she can be, moreover,
on occasion, a little mawkish; as in the instance where, after the sentiment has
been satisfied, she pumps up a feeling, and 'drags in by ear and horn' a struggling sentence
touching two doves in the room that once was <span class="smcap">Andre's</span>; their 'mated human
hearts,' and so forth. These and one or two kindred simulations, or ultra-sentimentalities,
are not <em>intellectually</em> feminine, and must be set down as defects in the generally natural
and fresh style of our gifted author, whose clever volume we are glad of an opportunity
warmly to commend to public acceptance. Some readers may find in it matters to condemn,
perhaps, but all will encounter much that is deserving of cordial praise.</p>

editors of which, (one of them the first of American poets,) in awarding their meed of
praise, candidly confessed that the production was more likely to be judged by a political
standard at the seat of government, than by any critical measure, based upon an
impartial consideration of its literary qualities. For ourselves, we must say that we
have perused the poem with a pleasure not a little enhanced by the reflection, that the
author has been enabled to find leisure, amidst engagements which, if one may believe
the partizan journals, must needs be numerous and pressing, to pay that attention to
literary pursuits, which by so many politicians, and utilitarians of another class, are considered
'useless, if not belittling, to a man of mental calibre sufficient for any thing more
manly than verse-making.' Indeed, this position we remember somewhere to have seen
assumed and defended, in the words we have quoted. The opening of 'Medorus'
Dream,' the fine lines on 'Death,' have already appeared in the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>, from
the manuscript of the author. They will be remembered not only by the readers of this
Magazine, but also by those of very many journals throughout the Union, into which
they were copied, with expressions of warm admiration. In selecting, therefore, a few
extracts, in corroboration of the justice of our encomiums, we shall plunge at once <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
medias res</i> into the volume before us; leaving our readers to judge whether the writer
does not exhibit a hearty love and keen observation of Nature, in her various phases; a
strong sense of the beautiful and the true; and an ease and smoothness of versification,
which go far to controvert the theory that, for certain reasons, (among which 'a restless
ambition' has been cited as the chief,) 'there can be little poetry in high places.' Take,
for example, the annexed brief but comprehensive glance at the four seasons:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Spring</span> laughing comes to bless the verdant land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet breezes kiss the glowing curls that lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her blooming cheek; a lambent fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plays from her radiant eyes; 'neath her light step<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daisies and cowslips grow. Upon the bud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She breathes, and quick the rose unfolds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its tinted leaves, and, trembling with keen bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sips the pure morning dews, and soft exhales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gentle odor through the garden's walks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More sweet than beauty's breath. Hark to those sounds!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warbling notes that rise upon the gale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steal o'er the soul like voices of pure prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dream of Eden's joys. O'er all the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm sunshine streams, whose fructifying rays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strike through the fibrous soil, and quicken there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand lovely forms; these straightway start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that deep sleep which heaven so kindly sends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through winter's rugged hour, while soon they join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The happy circle of all beauteous things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fill the world with perfume and with song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hailing their bounteous mistress, virgin Spring!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mark <span class="smcap">Summer</span>, sitting 'neath yon spreading palm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her shady throne. With matron dignity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gazes round, and smiles in quiet pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While counting o'er the glorious wealth that fills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wide domain. Now wave the growing fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the rip'ning winds and the warm sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the soft pulp of the distending fruits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imbibes rich nectar from the glowing beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the calm, golden day. Now Hope sits laughing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a world of light, and Promise near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weaves the bright numbers of a joyous lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Plenty still the burden of his theme.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next <span class="smcap">Autumn</span> comes, the sweet industrious maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who garners up the treasures of past days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brown nuts, and yellow grain, and ripen'd stores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mellow'd fruits; yet still a pensive smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As soft as moonlight on some slumb'ring stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throws o'er her face a melancholy shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sober thought, as though her heart was sad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the large harvests which her sickle wins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should leave the earth so bare. And then she sings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A plaintive strain that echoes through the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the wild cooings of some soft-toned dove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A note of resignation and of peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though still a sound of sadness from the soul.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo! <span class="smcap">Winter</span> rushes from the land of storms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the cold Arctic regions, where he sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mong clouds and darkness, and vast misshaped forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He comes, with frosts, and howling winds, and hail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dark terrors of a sunless sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unshorn his ragged beard, and his fierce eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Relentless as the murderer's stony heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Condemns the victim, while his icy breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More deadly than the lightning's fiery gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeps life into oblivion. Spirit, no;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man's finite faculties alone may see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such evil in God's goodness: we behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A crowning mercy of beneficence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Winter's coldest blast. Could earth exist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without that change in matter and in form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By which her strength recuperates, and lends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An impulse unto Nature's fostering will?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pulpy fruit would perish where it falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for the bitter kernel; flowers would fade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more mid sweet ambrosial dews to bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for the winter's torpid touch, that crusts<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The leathery seed with its rough coating o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freezes its ardent currents ere they spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into ephemeral being, and thus yields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto a small and leaden speck, a power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of life perpetual, and from dull clay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maintains a breathing world.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'A ducat to a beggarly denier' that we saw the same ocean, glowing under the same
glorious summer-evening light, as is described in the lines which ensue. We have
never compared notes with our author; but it seems impossible that the kindred scene
in which we revelled on a memorable occasion at the Telegraph station, by the Narrows,
should not have extended to Fire-Island; the <em>locale</em>, we cannot help inferring, of this
picture:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Oft</span> hath the man who loveth Nature's ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Musing, gone forth alone by Ocean's tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, gazing on that amaranthine plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath mark'd the rich beams of descending day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoot slanting o'er the light and feathery waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the sea, by burning passion moved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all its depths, turns into liquid gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaves and thrills beneath those ardent rays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With love too strong for mortal minds to know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With love too deep for mortal hearts to feel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, from that glorious main, his soul-lit eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath wander'd strait to heaven, and in one view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pearl, and flame, and amethyst, and gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadowy vermeil flush, the purple light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The amber-tinted streak, and banner'd clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like incense streaming up from Evening's shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wafted by gentle gales along the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty, brightness, majesty, and pomp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gorgeous splendor of the imperial West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst on his raptured sight! He, happy then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Fancy's spirit-form smiles o'er his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deems it the lovely sky that canopies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The land of Paradise.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here is a wider reach of more varied scenery, yet not less forcible than the more 'thin
compositions,' to use the painter's phrase:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">First</span>, as they look'd, there rose upon the sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long, waving chains of happy-smiling hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uprising gently from the sloping vales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if to woo the rustling noontide winds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next, wide-expansive, music-making seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across whose placid, soft-suspiring tides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The playful breezes fly, on tireless wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, 'neath their wond'ring eyes at once display'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, in one far-sweeping, lovely view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The broad green vesture of the quick'ning sod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling with heat, and glowing into life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the warm sun's vivifying beams:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Desert's thirsty plains gemm'd with their green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cool oases, bright mid barren sands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rivers whose pearly tides stretch'd far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through fertile lands to Ocean's emerald brink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lakes that seem'd, in their transparent depths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crystal eyes of Earth. Here mountains, hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winding dales, fair seas, and shining lakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silvery streams, gay-blooming boughs, and flowery turf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conspire, in all their loveliest power, to make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warm, the fresh, the pure, and beauteous form<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Of this enamell'd world.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lovers of flowers; gentle maidens, scarcely less fragile and fair; and ye of the
'sterner sex,' who are not ashamed to praise heaven and earth; we ask you if the ensuing
lines are not 'beautiful exceedingly:'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The red Rose, blushing in its virgin pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs lightly on its green and briery stalk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kisses from its pale-cheek'd sister's brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With trembling lip, the pearly tear away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here Violets, that spring by stealth at night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rarer scents and sweeter shapes than those<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ere yet the sun hath touch'd their dewy leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingle their balmiest odors and their hues<br /></span>
<span class="i8">With the soft-nectar'd sighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wind-flowers, pansies, hyacinths, oxlips,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">And sun-striped tulips tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the freighted airs themselves grow faint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on their weary way sink down to sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the silent wild-flowers watching there.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have purposely abstained from a detailed review or analysis of the poem under
notice; preferring that the reader should derive his impression of the performance from
such portions of it, taken almost at random, as we could command space to present;
leaving him to seek in the volume itself that gratification of which we are sure our
extracts will give him a foretaste. It was our intention to have animadverted upon the
use of certain words and compounds which struck us as being infelicitous; but we can
only transcribe a few of them, without comment, from our pencilled copy: '<span class="smcap">Jehovah's</span>
<em>fadeless</em> arms;' 'frost-enmirror'd;' 'sun-bedazzled;' '<em>ornamentless</em> curves;' 'rich-rubied
rays,' etc. 'To conclude:' we consider the present poem a manifest improvement upon
'Ahasuerus,' which was noticed at length in these pages. The author is now 'well in
harness,' and moves on without incumbrance. Once more we welcome him to the quiet
walks of literature, which he treads so pleasantly; and again we greet him with '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Macte
virtute</i>!'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ah!</span> young ladies! we wish you could 'realize' how greatly gratified we are to find
you so much improved! We say 'improved,' because it can scarcely be possible that
you could have written such charming compositions, before you had experienced the
benefits of the system of instruction pursued at the institution upon which you reflect so
much honor. We say this in no vain spirit of compliment, but in all candor. The
address of the President, Miss <span class="smcap">M. Robinson</span>, of this city, is not only excellent in its
inculcations and tendency, but is written with great perspicuity and freedom. The prize
poem by Miss <span class="smcap">Eliza Whitney</span> of Philadelphia, has many of the elements of true
poetry, while its trifling defects are merely mechanical. The committee who awarded
the prize, one of whom we observe was Mrs. <span class="smcap">Sigourney</span>, seem to have hesitated in
their choice between this and three or four other poems of kindred excellence. '<span class="smcap">Mary
Grafton</span>' need not have sheltered herself under a <i>pseudonyme</i>. Her essay on 'What
should be the intellectual education of Woman, to fit her for the duties of life,' is
worthy of a strong and disciplined mind and a practised pen. The honor of the best
essay in French was assigned to Miss <span class="smcap">M'Cormick</span> of Oswego, in this State; yet the
committee selected it in preference to three others, only 'because they were forced to
choose;' a fact which precludes the idea of 'rejection.' The capital tale entitled
'Home Education,' by Miss <span class="smcap">Mary E. Field</span>, of Haddam, (Conn.,) must certainly have
deserved the honor which it won among its rivals. We have rarely seen a story, the
lessons of which were so valuable, in a national point of view, kept up with so much
spirit, and eliciting so much interest, in the narrative. On the whole, so favorably are
we impressed with these 'exercises' of the alumnæ of the Albany Female Academy,
that we begin to peer into the 'onward distance,' and to see our own little people winning
honors in that popular institution. 'So mote it be!'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> is entitled a neat little volume which we find on our table. Without being a
'great gun' in literature, or destined to make much noise in the world, Mr. <span class="smcap">Cannon</span> is yet
a clever versifier, and occasionally 'goes off' with good thoughts very agreeably; while
'the habit of wishing to discover the good and the beautiful in all that meets and surrounds
him' is quite apparent in his compositions. The 'crowning hour' is the period
when <span class="smcap">Columbus</span> first discovers land from the quarter deck of his vessel. Certain incidents
of the voyage, and the emotions of the 'world-seeking Genoese,' form the staple
of the main poem; but the prose of <span class="smcap">Irving</span> is far better poetry than the verse which
here records them. The remainder of the volume is devoted to the republication of
several minor effusions from certain periodicals of these times, and from a previous
volume of the author. The 'Dogberryotype' portrait of Mr. <span class="smcap">Cannon</span>, in the opening
of his book, strikes us as being in bad taste. We are loath to interfere with such an
exhibition of harmless vanity; but the picture being what is negatively termed 'no
beauty,' we must adopt the advice of <span class="smcap">Holmes</span> to the plain gentleman whose portrait
graced the Athenæum exhibition: 'Don't let it be there any longer! Take it home, and
hush the matter up!' It is but justice to add, however, that the portrait which fronts
the volume under notice does not do justice to the features of its author. Engravings
from Daguerreotype miniatures have never impressed us favorably, either as faithful
likenesses, or specimens of pictorial art.</p>

<h2><a name="EDITORS_TABLE" id="EDITORS_TABLE">EDITOR'S TABLE.</a></h2>


<p>'<span class="smcap">The Mysteries of Paris.</span>'&mdash;A 'friend and fellow-citizen' of ours has translated,
so far as published, a serial novel, just now making a great noise in the literary circles of
the French capital, entitled '<cite>Les Mysteries de Paris</cite>,' by <span class="smcap">Eugene Sue</span>. Premising that
our readers will soon have an opportunity of perusing in an English translation some of
the most striking of the very remarkable sketches of this <span class="smcap">Dickens</span> of France, we shall
content ourselves for the present with a single extract, embodying a simple, but as it
strikes us, a very touching and impressive scene. The <span class="smcap">Rodolphe</span> of the passage
below is a German prince, who has come to Paris, and who goes forth in disguise to
seek out worthy objects of benevolence. He encounters in '<cite>La Cité</cite>,' a quarter of the
town occupied by the most abandoned classes, a girl of a beautiful, melancholy countenance,
called in the peculiar language of the inhabitants, '<i>La Goualeuse</i>,' or '<i>Fleur-de-Marie</i>,'
who turns out, in the subsequent progress of the story, to be a child of his own,
whom he supposed to be dead, but who had in fact been left in the streets by her nurses.
He proposes to take her into the country with him; and the effect which rural objects
produce upon her mind is very beautifully described in the little episode of 'The Rose-bush,'
which will be found in the opening of the story. The whole tale forcibly illustrates
what a French metropolitan contemporary terms the '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">inépuisable</i> imagination' of
<span class="smcap">Eugene Sue</span>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">I believe</span> you, and I thank you; but answer me frankly: is it equally agreeable what part of
the country we go to?'</p>

<p>'Oh, it is all the same to me, Monsieur Rodolphe, as long as it is the country; it is so pleasant;
the pure air is so good to breathe! Do you know that for five months I have been no farther than
the flower market, and if the <i>ogresse</i> ever allowed me to go out of the Cité, it was because she had
confidence in me?'</p>

<p>'And when you came to this market, was it to buy flowers?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no: I had no money; I only came to see them; to inhale their rich perfume. For the half
hour that the ogresse allowed me to pass on the quai during market-days, I was so happy that
I forgot all.'</p>

<p>'And when you returned to the ogresse&mdash;to those horrid streets?'</p>

<p>'I came back more sorrowful than when I set out. I choked down my tears, that I might not
receive a beating. I tell you what it was at the market which made me envious, oh! <em>very</em> envious;
it was to see the little '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ouvrières</i>,' so neatly clad, going off so gaily with a fine pot of flowers
in their arms!'</p>

<p>'I am sure if you had only had some flowers in your window, they would have been companions
for you.'</p>

<p>'It is very true what you say, Monsieur Rodolphe. Imagine: one day the ogresse at her fête,
knowing my love for flowers, gave me a little rose-bush. If you could only know how happy I
was! I was no longer lonesome! I could not keep from looking at my rose-bush. I amused
myself in counting its leaves, its flowers.... But the air is so bad in La Cité that at the end
of two days it began to fade.... But you'll laugh at me, Monsieur Rodolphe?'</p>

<p>'No, no! Go on! go on!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>'Well then, I asked permission from the ogresse to take my bush out for an airing; yes, as I
would have taken out a child. I brought it to the quai: I thought to myself, that being in company
with other flowers, in this fine and balmy air, would do it good. I moistened its poor withered
leaves with the pure water of the fountain, and then I warmed it awhile in the sun. Dear
little rose-tree! it never saw the sun in La Cité for in our street it comes no lower than the roof.
At length I returned; and I assure you, Monsieur Rodolphe, that my rose-bush lived perhaps ten
days longer than it would have done without the airings.'</p>

<p>'I believe it; but when it died!&mdash;that must have been a great loss for you.'</p>

<p>'I wept for it; I was very sorry.... Beside, Monsieur Rodolphe, since you understand how
one can love flowers, I can tell it to you. Well, I felt <em>grateful</em> to it. Ah! now <em>this</em> time you are
laughing at me!'</p>

<p>'No, no! I love, I adore flowers; and thus I can comprehend all the foolish things they cause
one to commit, or which they inspire.'</p>

<p>''Eh bien!' I felt grateful to this poor rose-bush, for having flowered so prettily for me&mdash;such
a one as me!' The goualeuse held down her head and became purple with shame.</p>

<p>'Poor child! with this consciousness of your horrible position, you must have often ...'</p>

<p>'Had a wish to put an end to it? Is it not so, Monsieur Rodolphe?' said la Goualeuse, interrupting
her companion. 'Oh! yes; more than once I have looked at the Seine from the parapet.
But then I turned to the flowers, the sun, and I said to myself, 'The river will always be
there.... I am only sixteen ... who knows?'</p>

<p>'When you said, '<em>Who knows</em>?' you had a hope?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'And what did you hope for?'</p>

<p>'I do not know. I hoped&mdash;yes, I hoped, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malgré moi</i>.' At those moments, it seemed to me that
my fate was not merited; that there was some good left in me. I said to myself, 'I have been
very much troubled, but at least, I have never harmed any one ... if I had only had some one
to counsel me, I should not be where I am. That dissipated my sorrow a little. After all, I
must confess that these thoughts occurred oftener after the loss of my rose-bush,' added la Goualeuse,
in a solemn manner, which made Rodolphe smile.</p>

<p>'This great grief always ...'</p>

<p>'Yes; look here!'&mdash;and la Goualeuse drew from her pocket a little packet, carefully tied with
a pink favor.</p>

<p>'You have preserved it?'</p>

<p>'I think so! It is all I possess in the world.'</p>

<p>'How! have you nothing you can call your own?'</p>

<p>'Nothing.'</p>

<p>'But this coral necklace?'</p>

<p>'It belongs to the ogresse.'</p>

<p>'How! do you not own a rag?&mdash;a hat, a handkerchief?'</p>

<p>'No, nothing; nothing but the dry leaves of my withered rose-bush; it is on this account I prize
it so much.'</p>

<p>'At each word the astonishment of Rodolphe was redoubled. He could not comprehend this
frightful slavery, this horrible sale of soul and body for a wretched shelter, a few tattered clothes,
and impure nourishment.</p>

<p>'They arrived at the '<i>Quai aux Fleurs</i>.' A carriage was in waiting. Rodolphe assisted his companion
to get in, and after placing himself at her side, said to the coachman:</p>

<p>'To Saint-Denis; I will tell you directly which road to take.'</p>

<p>'The horses started; the sun was radiant; the sky without a cloud; but the cold was a little
sharp, and the air circulated briskly through the open windows of the carriage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>'<span class="smcap">At</span> this moment they drew near to Saint-Ouen, at the juncture of the road to Saint-Denis and
the Chemin de la Revolte.</p>

<p>'Notwithstanding the monotonous appearance of the country, Fleur-de-Marie was so delighted
at seeing the fields, that forgetting the thoughts which sad recollections had awakened in her
mind, her charming face brightened up; she leaned out of the window, and cried:</p>

<p>'Monsieur Rodolphe! what delight!... Fields! and thickets! If you would only let me
alight! The weather is so fine! I would like so much to run in the meadows!'</p>

<p>'We will take a run, my child. Coachman, stop!'</p>

<p>'How! <em>you</em> also, Monsieur Rodolphe?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>'I also! yes, we will make it a holiday.'</p>

<p>'What happiness! Monsieur Rodolphe!'</p>

<p>'And Rodolphe and Fleur-de-Marie, hand in hand, ran over the new-mown field until they were
out of breath.</p>

<p>'To attempt to describe the little gambols, the joyous shouts, the fresh delight of Fleur-de-Marie
would be impossible. Poor gazelle! for so long time a prisoner, she breathed the pure
air with intoxication. She came, she went, she ran, she stopped, always with new transports.
At the sight of several tufts of daisies, and some marigolds, spread by the first frosts of approaching
winter, she could not refrain from fresh exclamations of delight. She did not leave a single
flower, but gleaned the whole meadow. After having thus ran over the fields&mdash;soon tired, being
unaccustomed to so much exercise&mdash;the young girl, pausing to take breath, seated herself on the
trunk of a tree, which lay prostrate near a deep ditch. The fair and transparent complexion of
Fleur-de-Marie, ordinarily too pale, was now shaded with the most lively color. Her large blue
eyes shone sweetly; her rosy mouth, half open, disclosed her pearl-like teeth; and her heart
throbbing under the little orange shawl, she kept one hand on her bosom as if to compress its pulsations,
while with the other she extended to Rodolphe the flowers she had gathered. Nothing
could be more charming than the innocent, joyous expression which shone in that lovely face.</p>

<p>'As soon as she could speak, she said to Rodolphe, with touching <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</i>:</p>

<p>'How kind is the <span class="smcap">Bon Dieu</span> for having given us such a fine day!'</p>

<p>'A tear came to the eyes of Rodolphe, as he heard this poor abandoned, despised, lost creature,
without home, without bread, offering thus a cry of joy and thanks to the <span class="smcap">Creator</span>, for the enjoyment
of a ray of sunshine and the sight of a meadow!'</p></blockquote>

<p>How do you like that, reader? 'Ithn't it thweet?' Excuse the levity; but we are
trying to divert away two or three persevering drops of salt-water. 'You shall see more

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. John Newland Maffitt: a Letter from the 'Literary Emporium.</span>'&mdash;A
friend of tried taste in matters literary, and a good judge of <em>style</em>, both in matter and
manner, whether out of the pulpit or in it, has sent us the following letter, written some
months since to a correspondent in Gotham. The sketch which it gives of the peculiar
eloquence of Rev. <span class="smcap">John Newland Maffitt</span> will be found to partake largely of the
qualities of that remarkable declaimer's pulpit efforts. We have heard Mr. <span class="smcap">Maffitt</span> for
five minutes perhaps at a time, when he was <em>truly</em> eloquent; when his action was natural,
his language pure, and his illustrations striking and beautiful. But a <em>sustained</em> flight
seemed beyond his powers. As was forcibly observed by a country auditor of his on one
occasion in our hearing: 'He is like a cow that gives a half-pail of the richest kind o'
milk, and then up's with her foot and kicks it all over!' But we are keeping the reader
from our friend's epistle:</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
<i>'Boston, Sunday Night.</i>
</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Dear</span> &mdash;&mdash;: A quiet day has closed at last, with an excitement so great as to fatigue even <em>my</em>
temperament; and being still too feverish for sleep, I will write you, as it lulls away, the history
of the matter. Fahrenheit has been rounding the hundred to-day, and this has added not a little
to the proverbial quiet of an Eastern Sabbath. After the afternoon service, Boston seemed to be
taking a profound sleep. The few feeble news-boys at the old State-House had disappeared; the
idlers at the New Exchange had done wondering; and Long-Wharf was too blistering hot for
any one to attempt a sail. It wouldn't do to venture into those cool, shady streets, that lead
nowhere, without an object; to be seen to turn and walk back would be wrong, in Boston. On
reaching my room I sank into an easy-chair, and thought of the prayer for rain and cooling winds,
and whether the hot south wind was made here or at the south side of Cuba. A boy's whistle,
some half a mile over the hill, at Bowdoin-Square, was the only evidence of life; and it was not
a little provoking, having nothing else to do, to be <em>obliged</em> to follow the little rascal, as he wound
through the 'Cracovienne,' with occasional snatches from 'Old Hundred' and 'Dundee,' and worry
at the intricate manner in which he combined those rather different harmonies. Perhaps the lad
was executing a refined torture upon some sober old citizen, <em>trying</em> to sleep after his long nap just
taken at church, and 'not quite prepared to say,' with his ear, (very puzzling to him,) that that boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
was 'doing a theatrical;' and of course it wouldn't do to take him up for whistling psalm-tunes.
'Not at all; certainly not; that was quite proper and praise-worthy. Let the boy whistle.' I
varied my own performances by occasionally leaning from the coolest window, to see if any body
<em>was</em> any where; and deciding in the negative, in a perfectly clear and distinct manner, waited for
the next voluntary from the whistling boy. A spruce young man, whom I had never seen before,
and who talked of <span class="smcap">Ashburton</span> as his bosom crony, had called in the morning, offering a seat at
church, and an invitation to dinner with Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, of the sunny land, on the Hill. Well, was
there ever such a fool as I, in lazily declining those invitations, thinking I could do better! That
was in the morning, with the glory of a whole day before me; but <em>now</em> with only that boy, and
all the papers read to the last accident! So kind in her, too. She had heard I was in town, and
thought I might be happy to see her. <em>Wouldn't</em> I? I have half a mind now, to send around and
say I will be there to breakfast!</p>

<p>'I smoked out my regret with a cigar that almost crumpled with the heat; and at last, the tea-clatter
at the Tremont roused me to the mental effort of declaring a Boston Sunday dull, decidedly
dull. About dark I ventured into the street, and all Boston was astir again; indeed, quite bustling
for the sober city; and every body so clean, so happy, so almost gay, if it were not Sunday,
and so exactly at the touching-off point, that I fancied they had all been rolling in the surf on the
shady side of Nahant, during the hot hours that I had been 'listlessly lounging life away.' Whew!
I couldn't bear it! I affected a little smartness, and mingled with the current, trying to be pleased
with, I couldn't say what; but privately in rather a hopeless humor, till I heard one man say
hurriedly, 'You can't get in;' and another, 'I'll try;' and off he went like a shot. Thinking I
had got hold of something at last, I followed; and as he had drab-breeches, kept an eye on him,
squeezing along up street and down street, by lane and by alley, till we came to a great stream
going one way, and directly fetched up square upon some thousand people, filling the whole
street, before a church; from which, above the hum of the crowd, came now and then the peal of
an organ, and a chorus of voices in hallelujahs. Looking up upon the sea of heads, I plunged in
as others plunged out, and found myself carried to the inner door of the church. The aisles were
so full that half way up men were too tight together to get their hats off; and the whole crowd,
inside and out, was dotted with women and girls, their bonnets jammed up tight, so that they
could only look the way they happened to face when stopping, whether desirable or not. All
sorts of speeches and odd remarks were bandied about in a subdued tone; and several fat men,
dripping, were let out to get dry; whereupon a man in a Roman nose slipped off his coat in a
twinkling, and looked around with immense satisfaction. The abstraction of the fat men had left
him, for the moment, just room to do it.</p>

<p>'Presently, from the far end of the church, the clear voice of <span class="smcap">Maffitt</span> came down upon the ear
like a silver bell, and the mass was still. He began at once, like a man who knew his calling,
and had mastered it. His voice was clear, full, and intelligible to the farthest ear it reached. He
commenced calmly, but with nerve and strength which took the whole mass with him at the onset;
and after getting fairly under way, he cast about for argument and illustration. Here began the
man's inspiration. His thoughts, bathed in sun-light, came rushing one upon another, gem upon
gem and crowd upon crowd; each full and bold as the stars of heaven; moving on like them,
separate, but together; falling into the ranks from all manner of places; throwing light upon each
other, like the spears of an host, and all speeding onward and upward to their destination. Pausing
with his forces in mid-heaven, he calls out again and again for tribute, and they glance in,
like sunbeams, from the land and the deep, from earth, and heaven, and the farthest star; till pleased
with his grouping, he sweeps the picture into a higher light, and shadows forth the Throne of the
<span class="smcap">Almighty</span>! This, with all variety of intonation, from clarion to trumpet; every nerve and muscle
in gesticulation; and no wandering, no pausing, but to the <em>point</em>, like a thunder-bolt! My
dear &mdash;&mdash;, where are you? If any where within hearing, I beg leave to say 'Good night!' I'm
tired, and presume you are.'</p>

'Yours, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;.'

<p><span class="smcap">Poems by Percival.</span>&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Percival</span> has recently put forth an exceedingly beautiful volume,
of some two hundred and fifty pages, entitled 'The Dream of a Day, and other Poems.' The
book is composed for the most part of a series of shorter pieces, part of which have been published
in a fugitive form, at different intervals since the publication of his last volume, in 1827,
while part have until now remained in manuscript. The longer piece, and one of the latest,
which opens and gives the title to the volume, takes its name partly from its subject and partly
from the time in which it was written. More than one hundred and fifty different forms or modifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
of stanza are introduced in the course of the volume, much of which is borrowed from
the verse of other languages, particularly of the German. The imitations of different classic
measures, as well as the songs for national airs, are particularly explained in the introduction to
each. We remark numerous gems in this collection which were written by Mr. <span class="smcap">Percival</span> for
the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>; a fact which we cannot doubt will secure the patronage of our readers for
the tasteful and most matter-full volume before us. We are not advised by whom the work is for
sale in New-York, but Mr. <span class="smcap">S. Babcock</span>, New-Haven, is the publisher; and it is but just to add,
that it reflects great credit upon his liberality and good taste.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">'The Attache:' by Sam Slick.</span>&mdash;The clock-maker has lost none of his shrewdness,
his acute observation, nor his sparkling humor. To be sure, many of his so-called
<em>Yankeeisms</em> are only specimens of cockney dialect; yet he has more genuine wit than is
to be found in all the 'down-east' letters which have been inflicted upon the public <em>ad
nauseam</em> any time these three years. 'Sumtotalize' these tiresome epistles, as Mr.
<span class="smcap">Slick</span> would say, and see what nine in ten of them amount to. Bad spelling, devoid of
the ludicrous ellipses which characterize the orthographical errors of Mr. <span class="smcap">Yellowplush</span>,
constitutes the principal attraction of their <em>style</em>; while their <em>staple</em> is derived from the
worn-out jokes of <span class="smcap">Hackett's</span> 'Solomon Swop' or 'Joe Bunker.' But to 'The
Attaché;' to portions of which, with but slight comment, we propose to introduce the
reader. Mr. <span class="smcap">Slick's</span> originality is the originality of <em>thought</em>, less than of <em>manner</em>. He
is no copyist; and while he equals <span class="smcap">Lacon</span> in saying 'many things in a few words,' he
never sacrifices truth to the mere external form of sententiousness. In his descriptions
he is never striking at the expense of verisimilitude; nor does he permit his observation
of character to be diverted from its naturalness by over-cumulative features in his picture,
which destroy so many otherwise clever limnings. Not inappropriate to this illustration,
by the by, is this brief but graphic description of one of a great number of old family
pictures which the 'Attaché' encounters in the baronial hall of a purse-proud <span class="smcap">John
Bull</span> 'of family,' in one of the shires of England: 'Here now is an old aunty that a
forten come from. She looks like a bale o' cotton, fust screwed as tight as possible, and
then corded hard. Lord! if they had only a given her a pinch of snuff when she was
full dressed and trussed, and sot her a sneezin', she'd a blowed up, and the forten would
have come twenty years sooner! Yes, it's a family pictur; indeed, they're all family
picturs. They are all fine animals, but over-fed and under-worked.' Observe the
wisdom of the ensuing sentence, illustrating that sort of brain-picking which some persons
resort to, while themselves are mum as oysters, upon subjects on which noncommitalism
is desirable: 'If I can see both eends of a rope, and only one man has hold of
one eend, and me of the t'other, why I know what I am about; but if I can only see my
own eend, I don't know who I am a pullin' agin.'</p>

<p>One of the most amusing sketches in Mr. <span class="smcap">Slick's</span> volume is an account of a 'pious
creeter,' a deacon, who exchanged an old worn-out and vicious horse for one which he
'considered worth six of it,' and which he thought gave him 'the best of the bargain, and
no mistake.' It turns out quite the other way, however, the good deacon's boasting to
the contrary notwithstanding:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">This</span> is as smart a little hoss,' says he, 'as ever I see. I know where I can put him off to a
great advantage. I shall make a good day's work of this. It is about as good a hoss-trade as I
ever made. The French don't know nothin' about hosses; they are a simple people; their priests
keep 'em in ignorance on purpose, and they don't know nothin'.' 'He cracked and bragged considerable,
and as we progressed we came to Montagon Bridge. The moment pony sot foot on it,
he stopped short, pricked up the latter eends of his ears, snorted, squealed, and refused to budge
an inch. The elder got mad. He first coaxed and patted, and soft-sawdered him, and then
whipped, and spurred, and thrashed him like anything. Pony got mad too, for hosses has tempers
as well as elders; so he turned to, and kicked right straight up on eend, like Old Scratch, and kept
on without stoppin' till he sent the elder right slap over his head slantendicularly, on the broad of
his back into the river, and he floated down through the bridge and scrambled out o t'other side.</p>

<p>'Creation! how he looked! He was so mad, he was ready to bile over; and as it was, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
smoked in the sun like a tea-kettle. His clothes stuck close down to him, as a cat's fur does to
her skin when she's out in the rain; and every step he took his boots went squish, squash, like an
old woman churnin' butter; and his wet trousers chafed with a noise like a wet flappin' sail. He
was a show; and when he got up to his hoss, and held on to his mane, and first lifted up one leg,
and then the other, to let the water run out of his boots, I couldn't hold in no longer, but laid back,
and larfed till I thought, on my soul, I'd fall off into the river too.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The elder is decidedly taken in. His new steed is as blind as a bat, and a member
of the '<em>opposition</em> party.' After a series of provoking annoyances, the new owner of the
beast finally succeeds in getting him on board a steam-boat; but on nearing the shore
the perverse animal jumps overboard:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The</span> captain havin' his boat histed, and thinkin' the hoss would swim ashore of himself, kept
right strait on; and the hoss swam this way, and that way, and every way but the right road, jist
as the eddies took him. At last he got into the ripps off Johnston's Pint, and they wheeled him
right round and round like a whip-top. Poor pony! he got his match at last. He struggled, and
jumpt, and plunged, and fort, like a man, for dear life. Fust went up his knowin' little head, that
had no ears; and he tried to jump up, and rear out of it, as he used to did out of a mire-hole
ashore; but there was no bottom there; nothin' for his hind foot to spring from; so down he went
agin, ever so deep; and then he tried t'other eend, and up went his broad rump, that had no tail;
but, there was nothin' for the fore feet to rest on nother; so he made a summerset, and as he went
over he gave out a great, long, eendwise kick, to the full stretch of his hind legs. Poor feller! it
was the last kick he ever gave in this world; he sent his heels straight up on eend, like a pair of
kitchen tongs, and the last I see of him was a bright dazzle, as the sun shined on his iron shoes,
afore the water closed over him forever.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Take in all the accessories of the above picture, reader, and you cannot fail to laugh as
heartily at the discomfiture of the pious but 'cunning' elder, as we ourselves did on its
first perusal. There is a fine touch of natural description, and not a little philosophy, in
the following sketch of a dinner at an English gentleman's country residence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Folks</span> are up to the notch here when dinner is in question, that's a fact; fat, gouty, broken-winded,
and foundered as they be. It's rap! rap! rap! for twenty minutes at the door; and in
they come, one arter the other, as fast as the sarvants can carry up their names. Cuss them sarvants!
it takes seven or eight of 'em to carry a man's name up stairs, they are so awful lazy, and
so shockin' full of porter. Well, you go in along with your name, walk up to old aunty, and
make a scrape, and the same to old uncle, and then fall back. This is done as solemn as if a feller's
name was called out to take his place in a funeral; that and the mistakes is the fun of
it. * * * Company are all come, and now they have to be marshalled two and two, lock and lock,
and go into the dinin'-room to feed. When I first came I was dreadful proud of that title, 'the
Attaché;' now I am glad it's nothin' but 'only an Attaché,' and I'll tell you why. The great guns
and big bugs have to take in each other's ladies, so these old ones have to herd together. Well,
the nobodies go together too, and sit together; and I've observed that these nobodies are the
pleasantest people at table, and they have the pleasantest places, because they sit down with each
other, and are jist like yourself, plaguy glad to get some one to talk to. Somebody can only visit
somebody, but nobody can go any where; and therefore nobody sees and knows twice as much
as somebody does. Somebodies must be axed, if they are as stupid as a pump; but nobodies
needn't, and never are, unless they are spicy sort o' folks; so you are sure of them, and they have
all the fun and wit of the table at their eend, and no mistake. I wouldn't take a title if they would
give it to me, for if I had one, I should have a fat old parblind dowager detailed on to me to take
in to dinner; and what the plague is her jewels and laces, and silks and satins, and wigs to me?
As it is, I have a chance to have a gal to take in that's a jewel herself; one that don't want no
settin' off, and carries her diamonds in her eyes, and so on. I've told our minister not to introduce
me as an Attaché no more, but as Mr. Nobody, from the state of Nothin', in America.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Slick's</span> ideas of what is facetiously termed 'music' is quite coincident with our
own. No 'difficult execution' and 'intricate passages' for him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">What's</span> that? It's music. Well, that's artificial too; it's scientific, they say; it's done by
rule. Jist look at that gal to the piany: first comes a little Garman thunder. Good airth and seas,
what a crash! It seems as if she'd bang the instrument all to a thousand pieces. I guess she's
vexed at some body and is a-peggn' it into the piany out of spite. Now comes the singin'; see
what faces she makes; how she stretches her mouth open, like a barn-door, and turns up the
white of her eyes, like a duck in a thunder-storm. She is in a musical ecstasy; she feels good
all over; her soul is a-goin' out along with that 'ere music. Oh, it's divine; and she is an angel,
ain't she? Yes, I guess she is; and when I'm an angel, I will fall in love with her: but as I'm
a man, at least what's left of me, I'd jist as soon fall in love with one that was a leetle more of a
woman, and a leetle less of an angel. But hello! what onder the sun is she about! Why, her
voice is goin' down her own throat, to gain strength, and here it comes out ag'in as deep-toned as
a man's; while that dandy feller alongside of her is a-singin' what they call falsetter. They've
actilly changed voices! The gal sings like a man, and that screamer like a woman! This is
science: this is taste: this is fashion: but hang me if it's natur'. I'm tired to death of it; but one
good thing is, you needn't listen without you like, for every body is talking as loud as ever.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>We are compelled to close our extracts with the subjoined capital hit at the naked
meeting-houses which 'obtain' in so many quarters of our goodly land, and the still
more naked 'doctrines' that constitute the weekly attractions which many of them
present to church-goers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The</span> meetin'-houses our side of the water, no matter where, but away up in the back country,
how teetotally different they be from 'em this side! A great big handsome wooden house, chock
full of winders, painted so white as to put your eyes out, and so full of light within that inside
seems all out-doors, and no tree nor bush, nor nothin' near it but the road fence, with a man to
preach in it that is so strict and straight-laced he will do <em>any thing</em> of a week day, and <em>nothin'</em> of a
Sunday. * * * Preacher there don't preach morals, because that's churchy, and he don't like
neither the church nor it's morals; but he preaches doctrine, which doctrine is, there's no Christians
but themselves. Well, the fences outside of the meetin'-house, for a quarter of a mile or so,
each side of the house, and each side of the road, ain't to be seen for hosses and wagons, and gigs
hitched there; poor devils of hosses that have ploughed, or hauled, or harrowed, or logged, or
snaked, or somethin' or nother all the week, and rest on a Sunday by alterin' their gait, as a man
rests on a journey by alterin' of his stirrup a hole higher or a hole lower.'</p></blockquote>

<p>This episode is concluded with some remarks upon the 'clerical twang' which distinguishes
some of the divines of our country: 'Good men always speak through the nose.
It's what comes out of the mouth that defiles a man; but there is no mistake in the nose;
it's the porch of the temple!' We are pleased to learn that another volume of 'The
Attaché' will ere long be given to the public. We await its publication with impatient
interest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Gossip with Readers and Correspondents.</span>&mdash;'What is the man driving at' who sends us
the following? Does he intend a satire upon the peculiar style of Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>, who 'skims the
superfices' of society with more ease and grace than any magazine-writer of this era? Or is our
correspondent in love, and desirous of walking under a cloud while he reveals his passion? Let
him answer: 'The top of the morning to you, my dear <span class="smcap">Editor</span>; and as your sun goes up the
meridian, may your shadow be longer! I can wish you nothing more improbable; but in wishes
not to be granted, I will have the satisfaction of wishing to the outside of my desire. Coming
home last evening, I called on a pretty woman, for a half-hour's oblivion of matter-of-fact. A
few weeks since she had seen <span class="smcap">Willis</span> and a very charming damsel at Saratoga Springs, and
had noticed them occasionally at a delightful spot in the neighborhood, which I shall not indicate;
a retreat such as a poet would choose in parting with his best thoughts, and far holier than the
parting of mere lips would need; for I take it, this good-by, this farewell to the pets of the heart;
this sense of lost identity gone to the public; the loosing of the dove that may no where find a spot
to rest amid the waters; the spring of the falcon that <em>will</em> away; I say, Mr. <span class="smcap">Editor</span>, these things
are sometimes very solemn and affecting. Well, upon that spot was found a crumpled paper,
scrawled over with the goose-tracks of genius, and signed '<span class="smcap">N. P. Willis</span>, Junior.' The product
of <span class="smcap">Willis</span> by his <em>match</em> should be something brilliant, to be sure; but the Junior is evidently still
young in years. His opening phrase, (more applicable in these times to a bank-note than any
other mistress,) and several other naïve spots, indicate the come-over-ativeness and allowable
tenderness of a first passion. It is written in a kind of halting verse, that might easily be done
into <em>blank</em>, I should say. It is crowned with stars, signifying I suppose that this world has nothing
left worth looking at, and this beautiful motto, from Keats:</p>


<p class="center">'A THING OF BEAUTY IS A JOY FOREVER.'</p>

<p class="center">BY N. P. WILLIS, JUN.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Dearest!</span> I thank thee, bless thee, pray the highest God to bless thee evermore, thou charm of the world
to me! And now how beautiful the world again! The glorious sunlight, the waving trees, and faces of
familiar friends, before so common-place&mdash;all now how beautiful! for thou hast smiled on them! A rush
of joy is at my heart again, as if my pulse at each throb ran kisses from thy lips. Ah' could I take thy breath
in one long kiss, and give thee Heaven, which were happier?&mdash;thou with the stars above, or I with mine
and thy dear heart forever? How fast the time goes on! The world that lagged but yesterday, and seemed
about to stop for very dullness, seems an express, as though the stars were nearing us, and <span class="smcap">God</span> were coming
down, and we were hastening to the embrace of Heaven. How my spirits mount again! I look into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
heavens, face to face, and angels bending down, are whispering that I may yet be happy. Poor, poor fool!
Happy for another hour, perhaps another day, and then&mdash;&mdash;Why, then the sun will rise again, and all the
world be glad, but I shall not know it; and every tone that to the common world is sweetest music, and every
look and smile that are unlike thee; the song not thine; the book not read by thee; and every beautiful and
lovely thing, that hath not caught some parted grace of thine, shall be to me a half-formed thing, lacking the
tint that's loveliest, the form that's dearest to my heart; a thing unfinished, as Heaven were interrupted in
the making, or lost the trick, not having thee to copy! But now, the dashing of my heart is like the seas that
clap their hands in gladness. My <span class="smcap">God</span>, I thank Thee for that 'joy forever!' Those words have mingled with
my spirit, quickening it to lightning; and if I get a home above, and have a power in Heaven, I'll build a
world whose sky shall light it with those burning words! Ah, how the time goes on! I miss it not, for I
am happy, and it brings no change. The sun has set, and night has come with countless stars, as glowing,
beautiful, and bright, as each one were a separate joy of mine; a heaven all full, as is my brimming heart.
Well; you will laugh at all this rhapsody, and chide me for a foolish boy. I only say, 'My <span class="smcap">HEART</span> is talking
to you, not my <span class="smcap">HEAD</span>.' * * * But we must part; and then, if angels, strayed from home, may note that scene,
touched by the love of one so beautiful, it will be written down in Heaven, that two souls made to match,
have gone apart forever. Farewell! I only ask of you, that when a warm thought flutters at your heart,
just fancy ('t will be true) that I have come to nestle there, and give it welcome. And when the night comes,
and you rest alone with your own beauty and the sentinel stars, oh, clasp the little rascal to your heart,
and&mdash;&mdash;think of your dream in the morning!'</p></blockquote>

<p>Our impression is&mdash;'we may be wrong, but that is our opinion'&mdash;that the young gentleman
who penned the foregoing rhapsody is hankering after some young woman. Ah! well; though
his style is not over-pellucid, there is much truth in his sentences. There is a communion between
the heart of Nature and the hearts of lovers; and with gentle affections and pure thoughts, her
face is always beautiful. With the same mail which brought us the 'Thing of Beauty' aforesaid,
came the following, copied in the neatest of all crow-quill chirography, bearing the Saratoga
post-mark, and a French-gray seal, with two loving doves. It struck us, on a first perusal, that
possibly it might proceed from some young lady in love with some young gentleman! 'It has that
look:'</p>

<p>No sneers, if you please, gentlemen bachelors of the incorrigible class; no 'pshaws!' ye
'paired but not matched' people, at encountering here these tender tributes of the heart; for the
lover, where is he not? 'Wherever parents look round upon their children, there he has been;
wherever children are at play together, there he soon will be; wherever there are roofs under
which men dwell, wherever there is an atmosphere vibrating with human voices, there is the
lover, and there is his lofty worship going on. True love continues and will continue to send up
its homage amidst the meditations of every eventide, and the busy hum of noon, and 'the song of
the morning stars.' . . . If the unhappy young man who has recently filled the journals of the
metropolis with the details of his folly and crime could, before yielding to temptation, have looked
in upon the state-prisoners at Sing-Sing, as we did the other day, surely he would have shrunk
back from the vortex before him. Poor wretches, in their best estate! How narrow their cells;
how ceaseless their toil; what a negation of comfort their whole condition! It was a sweltering
August day, breathless and oppressive; but there was no rest for the eight hundred unhappy
convicts who plied their never-ending tasks within those walls. Stealthy glances from half-raised
eyes; pale countenances, stamped with meek submission, or gleaming with powerless
hate or impotent malignity; and 'hard labor' in the fullest sense, were the main features of the
still-life scene, as we passed through the several work-shops. But what a picture was presented
as their occupants came swarming into the open court-yard at sound of the bell, to proceed to
their cells with their dinner! From the thick atmosphere of the carpet and rug-shops, leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
clack of shuttles, the dull thump of the 'weaver's beam,' and the long, confused perspective of
cords, and pullies, and patterns, and multitudinous 'harness,' they poured forth; from murky
smithys, streamed the imps of <span class="smcap">Vulcan</span>, grim as the dark recesses from which they emerged; from
doors which open upon interminable rows of close-set benches burst forth the knights of the awl
and hammer; the rub-a-dub of the cooper's mallet, the creak of his shaving-knife, were still; the
stone-hammer was silent; and the court-yard was full of that striped crew! God of compassion!
what a sight it was, to see that motley multitude take up, in gangs, their humiliating march!
Huge negroes, weltering in the heat, were interspersed among 'the lines;' hands crimson with
murder rested upon the shoulders of beings young alike in years and crime; the victim of bestiality
pressed against the heart-broken tool of the scathless villain; and <em>all</em> were blended in one
revolting mass of trained soldiers of guilt; their thousand legs moving as the leg of one man: all
in silence, save the peculiar sound of the sliding tread, grating not less upon the ear than the
ground. One by one, they took their wooden pails of dingy and amphibious-looking 'grub,' and
passed on, winding up the stairs of the different stories, and streaming along the narrow corridors
to their solitary cells. It was too much for the tender heart of poor E., this long procession
of the gangs. As they passed on in slow succession, her lip began to quiver; and one after
another drops of pity rolled down her cheek. 'All these,' said she to the keeper, 'had a
mother, who looked upon their childhood, and blessed their innocence! Ah! how many infant
feet, softer than velvet to the touch, have been pressed to maternal lips, that now shuffle along
these prison-isles!' There spoke 'the mother;' and with her 'gentle words of pity' we take
our leave of the State's-prison and its unhappy inmates. * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> love of literature is a beneficial
and noble propensity of soul. 'It cannot be doubted,' writes the accomplished <span class="smcap">Mary Clavers</span>,
'that every accession of intellectual light carries with it an increase of happiness; happiness
which depends not in any great degree upon the course of public events, and not, beyond a
certain limited extent, upon the smiles of fortune. Those debasing and embittering prejudices
which must ever wait upon ignorance, melt away in the rays of mental illumination, and every
departed prejudice leaves open a new inlet for happiness. I may be considered an enthusiast, but
it is my deliberate conviction that next to religion&mdash;heart-felt, operative religion&mdash;a true love of
reading is the best softener of the asperities of life, the best consoler under its inevitable ills.'
<span class="smcap">Hood</span>, writing recently 'from his bed' to the Secretary of a provincial Athenæum, of which he
had been elected a 'patron,' deposes to the comfort and 'blessing that literature can prove in seasons
of sickness and sorrow; how generous mental food can atone for a meagre diet; 'rich fare
on paper, for short commons on the cloth.' Although ill, and condemned to lenten fare, animal
food being strictly interdicted, yet the 'feast of reason and the flow of soul' were still his. 'Denied
beef, I had <i>Bul</i>-wer and <i>Cow</i>-per; forbidden mutton, there was <i>Lamb</i>; and in lieu of pork,
<i>Bacon</i> or <i>Hogg</i>.' Eschewing wine, he had still his <i>Butler</i>; and in the absence of liquor, all the
<i>choice spirits</i>, from <span class="smcap">Tom Brown</span> to <span class="smcap">Tom Moore</span>. Confined physically to water, he had yet not
only the best of 'home-made' but the champaigne of <span class="smcap">Moliere</span>, the hock of <span class="smcap">Schiller</span>, and the
sherry of <span class="smcap">Cervantes</span>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Depressed</span> bodily by the fluid that damps every thing, I got intellectually elevated with <span class="smcap">Milton</span>, a little
merry with <span class="smcap">Swift</span>, or rather jolly with <span class="smcap">Rabelais</span>, whose Pantagruel, by the way, is quite equal to the best
gruel with rum in it. So far can literature palliate or compensate for gastronomical privations. But there
are other evils, great and small, in this world, which try the stomach less than the head, and the temper,
and ill winds that blow with the pertinacity of monsoon. Of these, Providence has allotted me a full share;
but still, paradoxical as it may sound, my burthen has been greatly lightened by a load of books. Many,
many a dreary, weary hour have I got over; many a mental or bodily annoyance forgotten, by help of the
tragedies and comedies of our dramatists and novelists! Many a trouble has been soothed by the still small
voice of the moral philosopher; many a dragon-like care charmed to sleep by the sweet song of the poet!
For all which I cry incessantly, not aloud, but in my heart. 'Thanks and honor to the glorious masters of
the pen, and the great inventors of the press!'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Isn't</span> <em>Law</em> a very curious thing, take it altogether? An adept in it must needs know all the
precedents, all the legal discussions and litigations; must read innumerable volumes, filled with
innumerable subtleties and cohesions, and written in an unintelligible jargon; must study rules
by which a certain class of future events shall be judged, when those events can only be partially
and imperfectly foreseen; a rule which never varies, while the cases never agree; a law
which is general while the cases are individual; a law where the penalty is uniform, while the
justice or injustice of the case is continually different. Who 'in view of these things' can wonder
that the worse is often made to appear the better reason? Does not a lawyer triumph most,
and acquire most fame, when he can gain a cause in the very teeth of the law he professes to support
and revere? Who is the greatest lawyer? Not he who can most enlighten, but he who can
most perplex and confound the understanding and embroil and mislead the intellect of judge and
jury. We have before us a striking illustration of these remarks, in an unsettled case in the
Court of Errors, on an appeal from a decree of the chancellor. A wife and mother, well stricken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
in years, leaves the bed and board of her husband, in consequence of long-continued ill treatment,
and by 'her next friend' sues for alimony. Her husband, it appears in evidence, is an
'unclean beast' personally; moreover, he throws his tea-cup at her at the table; will not permit
her to have a fire in the room in which she is ill, though it is in the depth of winter, but opens
doors and windows to freeze her out; orders all the beds taken down, that she may not sleep;
goes himself about the house at times <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in puris naturalibus</i>; threatens to throw his wife into the
well; when she is seated on a chair, pushes her out of it, and when she takes another, pushes her
out of that also, and so forth. Now reader, it would amuse you to look over the 'Points on the
part of the Apellant' in this case. By <em>his</em> 'next friend,' the attorney, he complains that vice-chancellors
are exceeding their credentials in assuming to be 'Chesterfieldian censors of the lesser
morals.' He admits indeed that the husband was '<em>uncourteous</em>, in rudely throwing his tea-cup
instead of handing it respectfully to the lady-in-waiting,' meaning the wife aforesaid; that he was
guilty of '<em>impoliteness</em>, in capriciously commanding a change of chairs;' that he certainly did use
'an <em>inconsiderate expression</em> concerning the well;' but that in driving his wife out of her sick room,
by opening all the doors and windows on a cold winter-day, he was only 'enforcing wholesome
exercise as a substitute for prejudicial inaction!' All these examples, let us add, are of the <em>lesser</em>
abuses and grievances which the unhappy woman suffered, year after year; yet the 'deeds without
a name' are softened or defended with equal plausibility and ingenuity. The counsel for the appellant
objects to the interference of the law-officers with such matters. 'Courts of chancery,' says
he, with true Johnsonian grandiloquence, 'cannot, like ecclesiastical tribunals or inquisitions,
regulate, by means of auricular confession and domiciliary visitation, connubial rights and duties!
The chancellor's doctrine would perpetuate wordy wars and family feuds, and impart to conjugal
caterwauling more than feline vitality!' But hold; we are 'interfering between man and wife,'
an injudicious act, as 'tis said. * * * 'D. G.'s '<i>Height of Impudence</i>' (it is <em>not</em> 'new') reminds
us of an incident which occurred in the hearing of a friend at one of our cheap metropolitan eating-houses
last winter. A tall, raw boned Hibernian called for a dish of pork-and-beans. 'Let
it be 'most all pork, and plenty of beans,' said he; and a liberal supply was placed smoking
before him. Before he had gorged his fill, he called for more bread; it was given him, and soon
disappeared, with the remainder of his dish. He then called for another slice, and was piling the
butter in pyramids upon small pieces of the same, when the waiter, who had been eyeing him
closely, and who thought the repast 'rather too much for a shilling,' addressed him with: 'Mister,
that butter cost two shillings and sixpence a pound.' The huge feeder said nothing, but proceeded
to pile about a quarter of a pound of it on a small crust of bread, placed it in his mouth,
rolled it for a time 'as a sweet morsel under his tongue,' and then remarked: 'Well, I should say
'twas <em>well wor-r-th it</em>!' His main anxiety appeared to be, to convince the waiter that his principal
had not been 'taken in' by the vender. * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> promised that our readers should renew
their acquaintance with '<i>Hugh Trevor</i>;' accordingly we condense a scene or two from that
remarkable work. Going down St. James'-street, London, one evening, with a person who has
treated him with much civility, our hero is run violently against by an accomplice of his companion,
knocked down, and robbed of all his money. His 'civil' friend leaves him in the lurch, and
he seeks his lodgings, there being no remedy for his loss. To divert his mind, he repairs to the
theatre, and takes his stand among the crowd which surround the entrance. He observes that the
people about him seem watchful of each other; and presently the cry of 'Take care of your
pockets!' renews his fears; and putting his hand to his fob, he misses his watch! Looking
eagerly around, he fixes his eyes upon his quondam friend, who had aided in robbing him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The</span> blood mantled in my face. 'You have stolen my watch,' said I. He could not immediately
escape, and made no reply, but turned pale, looked at me as if entreating silence and commiseration, and put
a watch into my hand. I felt a momentary compassion, and he presently made his retreat. His retiring did
but increase the press of the crowd, so that it was impossible for me so much as to lift up my arm: I therefore
continued, as the safest way, to hold the watch in my hand. Soon afterward the door opened, and I hurried
it into my waistcoat pocket: for I was obliged to make the best use of all my limbs, that I might not be
thrown down and trodden underfoot. At length, after very uncommon struggles, I made my way to the
money door, paid, and entered the pit. After taking breath and gazing around me, I sat down and inquired
of my neighbors how soon the play would begin? I was told in an hour. This new delay occasioned me to
put my hand in my pocket and take out my watch, which as I supposed had been returned by the thief. But,
good Heavens! what was my surprise when in lieu of my own plain watch, in a green chagrin-case, the
one I was now possessed of was set round with diamonds! And, instead of ordinary steel and brass, its appendages
were a weighty gold chain and seals! My astonishment was great beyond expression! I opened it
to examine the work, and found it was capped. I pressed upon the nut and it immediately struck the hour.
It was a repeater!'</p></blockquote>

<p>It will not greatly puzzle the reader, we may presume, to conjecture what this adroit movement
on the part of the pick-pocket ultimately led to; nor will he fail to recognize in the following
limning a portrait of more than one character of these times. Mr. <span class="smcap">Glibly</span> is entertaining Mr. <span class="smcap">Trevor</span>
with a running commentary upon some of the prominent personages who enter the theatre:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">There</span>,' said he pointing, is a Mr. <span class="smcap">Migrate</span>; a famous clerical character, and as strange an original as any
this metropolis affords. He is not entitled to make a figure in the world either by his riches, rank, or understanding;
but with an effrontery peculiar to himself he will knock at any man's door, though a perfect stranger,
ask him questions, give him advice, and tell him he will call again to give him more on the first opportunity.
By this means he is acquainted with every body, but knows nobody; is always talking, yet never
says any thing; is perpetually putting some absurd interrogation, but before it is possible he should understand
the answer, puts another. His desire to be informed torments himself and every man of his acquaintance,
which is almost every man he meets: yet, though he lives inquiring, he will die consummately ignorant.
His brain is a kind of rag shop, receiving and returning nothing but rubbish. It is as difficult to affront
as to get rid of him: and though you fairly bid him begone to-day, he will knock at your door, march into
your house, and if possible keep you answering his unconnected, fifty times answered queries to-morrow.
He is the friend and the enemy of all theories and of all parties: and tortures you to decide for him which
he ought to choose. As far as he can be said to have opinions, they are crude and contradictory in the
extreme; so that in the same breath he will defend and oppose the same system. With all this confusion of
intellect, there is no man so wise but he will prescribe to him how he ought to act. He has been a great
traveller, and continually abuses his own countrymen for not adopting the manners and policy of other
nations. He pretends to be the universal friend of man, a philanthropist on the largest scale, yet is so selfish
that he would willingly see the world perish, if he could but secure paradise to himself. This is the only
consistent trait in his character. In the same sentence, he frequently joins the most fulsome flattery and
some insidious question, that asks the person whom he addresses if he do not confess himself to be both
knave and fool. Delicacy of sentiment is one of his pretensions, though his tongue is licentious, his language
coarse, and he is occasionally seized with fits of the most vulgar abuse. He declaims against dissimulation,
yet will smilingly accost the man whom&mdash;&mdash;'Ha! <span class="smcap">Migrate!</span> How do you do? Give me leave to introduce
you to Mr. <span class="smcap">Trevor</span>, a friend of mine, a gentleman and a scholar; just come from Oxford. Your range of
knowledge and universal intimacy with men and things, may be useful to him; and his erudite acquisitions,
and philosophical research, will be highly gratifying to an inquirer like you. An intercourse between you
must be mutually pleasing and beneficial, and I am happy to bring you acquainted.' This, addressed to the
man whom he had been satirizing so unsparingly, was inconceivable! The unabashed facility with which
he veered from calumny to compliment, and that too after he had accused the man whom he accosted of
dissimulation, struck me dumb. I had perhaps seen something like it before, but nothing half so perfect
in its kind. It doubly increased my stock of knowledge; it afforded a new instance of what the world is,
and a new incitement to ask how it became so?'</p></blockquote>

<p>A single passage more, which will have especial interest for the correspondent to whom we are
indebted for the capital sketch of '<i>Love-Making in Boarding-Houses</i>,' must close our excerpts. A
maiden of an uncertain age is making a 'dead set' at our hero:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">She</span> was sure I must find myself a great favorite; I was a favorite with every body; and, for her part, she
did not wonder at it. 'Not but it is a great pity,' added she, aside, 'that you are such a rake, Mr. <span class="smcap">Trevor</span>.'
This repeated charge very justly alarmed my morality, and I very seriously began a refutation. But in vain.
'I might say what I would; she could see very plainly I was a prodigious rake, and nothing could convince
her to the contrary. Though she had heard that your greatest rakes make the best husbands. Perhaps it
might be true, but she did not think she could be persuaded to make the venture. She did not know what
might happen, to be sure; though she really did not think she could. She could not conceive how it was,
but some how or another she always found something agreeable about rakes. It was a great pity they should
be rakes, but she verily believed the women loved them, and encouraged them in their seducing arts. For
her part, she would keep her fingers out of the fire as long as she could: but, if it were her destiny to love a
rake, what could she do? Nobody could help being in love, and it would be very hard indeed to call what
one cannot help, a crime.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> must commend the cogent arguments in favor of national theft, contained in the article on
'<i>International Copy-right</i>' in preceding pages, to the attention of the reader. It strikes us as one
of the most tenable positions yet taken by the opponents of an exceedingly 'impolitic' literary
measure. By the by; a new '<i>American Copy-right Club</i>' has been recently established, with
<span class="smcap">William Cullen Bryant</span> and <span class="smcap">Gulian C. Verplanck</span>, Esquires, for its president and vice-president;
and for its secretaries and executive committee, several of the most prominent advocates
of the proposed law to be found in our midst; including, we are glad to perceive, Mr. <span class="smcap">Puffer
Hopkins Mathews</span>, who has labored more abundantly than they all in the good cause, but with
little success hitherto, we regret to be obliged to add. His metropolitan lecture last winter could
scarcely have realized his own expectations; though it was not difficult to meet those of the public.
A friend of ours who repaired early to the Tabernacle, with a ticket bearing a number above
twelve hundred, found not three-score auditors in that capacious edifice. It is equally certain,
that the following 'unkindest cut of all' at Mr. <span class="smcap">Mathews's</span> international copy-right <em>essays</em>,
which reaches us in the last number of the '<cite>Dublin University Magazine</cite>,' embodies the opinion
generally entertained of those efforts on this side the Atlantic: 'While on the subject of America,
we would wish to add a line of a certain <span class="smcap">Cornelius Mathews</span>, who writes pamphlets and
delivers lectures in New-York, on the subject of an international copy-right law. Such is the
complex involution of his style; such the headlong impetuosity with which tropes, figures, and
metaphors run down, jostle, and overturn each other, that we have puzzled ourselves in vain to
detect his meaning or the gist of his argument. Giants, elephants, '<em>tiger-mothers</em>,' and curricles;
angels, frigates, baronial castles, and fish-ponds, 'dance through his writings in all the mazes of
metaphorical confusion;' and however desirous we may feel that a law of copy-right might protect
British authors from American piracy, yet as one of the craft we boldly say: '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non defensoribus
istis! non tali auxilio!</i>' Let the question be put forward manfully and intelligibly; let it not be a
piece of Indian jugglery, performed by <span class="smcap">Cornelius Mathews</span>, but the plain and simple acknowledgement
that literary property is property, and as such has its rights, sacred and inviolable.'
We have quoted this passage for the purpose of showing that our own opinion of Mr. <span class="smcap">Mathews's</span>
rambling thoughts and disjointed style finds abundant confirmation wherever his 'writings' are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
forced into temporary notice. * * * '<span class="smcap">Served</span> you right!' Carelessness like your's deserved just
such a result. You'll not be guilty of a similar act of folly very soon, ''tan't likely:'</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">The</span> blank-verse <em>halts</em> for it' in the lines entitled '<i>Mournful Memories</i>.' Beside, the tendency
of the sentiment is not, we think, a useful one. Were all the dangers or ills of life to present
themselves to the imagination in a body, drawn up in battle array, the prospect would indeed be
dreadful; but coming individually, they are far less formidable, and successively as they occur
are conquered. Foreboded, their aspect is terrific; but seen in retrospect, they frequently excite
present satisfaction and future fortitude. 'It is with human life as with the phases of nature,
whose regular course is calm and orderly; tempests and troubles being but lapses from the accustomed
sobriety with which Providence works out the destined end of all things.' * * * <span class="smcap">Much</span> is
said of the 'freedom' or 'licentiousness' of our public press; but we are far behind the press of
London in this regard. Look for example at the comments in some of the London journals upon
the recent marriage of the Hereditary Duke of Mecklenburg, a 'royal pensioner,' with the Princess
<span class="smcap">Augusta</span> of Cambridge. The produce of his dukedom is described by the '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Charivari</i>' as
consisting of 'nothing in particular; its revenue purely nominal.' The wedding is turned into
the broadest ridicule. The Duke had an audience of himself in the morning in the glass of his
dressing-case; his 'master of the wardrobe, who was also comptroller of the leather portmanteau
and groom of the hat-box,' being the only person in attendance. 'He wore the <em>white seam</em> of the
German order of princes, and was looking remarkably well&mdash;as all the annuitants of England
contrive generally to look.' The ceremony was performed in the usual style of royalty. And
when the prelate who performed the office came to the words 'With all my worldly goods I thee
endow,' the Duke of Cambridge, who always thinks out loud, kept up a running accompaniment:
'Well, that's capital! worldly goods, indeed! I should like to see some of 'em!' and other
pleasant observations; all which were taken to be a gush of fervent ejaculations from the father
of the bride, invoking the happiness of the newly-married couple. The happy pair set out for
Kew, to which place the Duke's Lord of the Luggage had already conveyed his carpet-bag! The
<i>trousseau</i> of the Princess had been laid out at Cambridge House for the inspection of the bride's
friends; 'but the illustrious bridegroom, with more modesty, laid out <em>his</em> trousseau on the bed in
his private apartment, previous to packing.' Various articles are enumerated; among the rest,
'a splendid uniform for state occasions, consisting of the superb coat of an officer of the Blues,
with Grenadier trowsers and a Lifeguards-man's helmet;' 'twelve false collars; nine pairs of
cotton socks; two stocks, with long ends,' etc., etc. Such an invasion of aristocratic privacy may
be termed 'licentiousness of the press' with as much truth, we conceive, as any of the gossipry
of the American newspapers. * * * <span class="smcap">In</span> looking lately over the '<cite>Souvenirs Historiques</cite>' of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>
and <span class="smcap">Maria Louisa</span>, by the Baron <span class="smcap">Meneval</span>, his 'ancient secretary,' we were forcibly
impressed with a passage which depicts the love of the Great Captain for his infant son. The
child was brought every morning to his apartment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Yes</span>: that cabinet, which saw the origin of so many mighty plans, so many vast and generous schemes of
administration, was also witness to the effusions of a father's tenderness. How often have I seen the emperor
keeping his son by him as if he were impatient to teach him the art of governing! Whether, seated by the
chimney on his favorite sofa, he was engaged in reading an important document, or whether he went to his
bureau to sign a despatch, every word of which required to be weighed, his son, seated on his knees, or
pressed to his breast, was never a moment away from him. Sometimes, throwing aside the thoughts which
occupied his mind, he would lie down on floor beside his beloved boy, playing with him like another
child, attentive to every thing that could please or amuse him. The emperor had a sort of apparatus for trying
military man&oelig;uvres: it consisted of plates of wood fashioned to represent battalions, regiments, and
divisions. When he wanted to try some new combinations of troops, or some new evolution, he used to
arrange these pieces on the carpet. While he was seriously occupied with the disposition of these pieces,
working out some skilful man&oelig;uvre which might ensure the success of a battle, the child, lying at his side,
would often overthrow his troops, and put into confusion his order of battle, perhaps at the most critical
moment. But the emperor would recommence arranging his men with the utmost good humor.'</p></blockquote>

<p>How different the scene with these mimic troops, from that presented by his human legions!
No long columns of smoke streamed up from <em>their</em> line of march, indicating burning villages and
fields trampled in the dust; no explosions of artillery; no thundering of cavalry; no steel clanging
with steel in the desperate conflict of life for life; no smoke, nor darkness, nor infernal din;
no groans of the dying; no piercing shouts, revealing the last fierce efforts of human nature,
wrought up to the infuriated recklessness of revenge and despair. None of these! Not greater
was the difference between that infant and his sire! Yet it <em>is</em> a pleasant feature in the character
of <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, his love of children. 'He entered,' says Miss <span class="smcap">Balcombe</span>, who knew him so intimately
at St. Helena, 'into all the feelings of young people, and when with them was a mere
child, and a most amusing one. I think his love of children, and the delight he felt in their society;
and that too at the most calamitous period of his life, when a cold and unattachable nature would
have been abandoned to the indulgence of selfish misery; in itself speaks volumes for his goodness
of heart.' * * * <span class="smcap">Ah!</span> yes; we understand your insinuation, dear Sir, and 'possibly <em>may</em> wish
that we had let you alone.' And yet, here is your letter before us, <em>requesting</em> 'an opinion of the
merits of your piece, in the entertaining gossip of the Editor's Table!' How does <em>that</em> read?
Our correspondent, if his ability were equal to his inclination, would doubtless make us feel the
truth of this scrap of advice from one who was a judge of human nature: 'Let no man despise
the opinion of <em>blockheads</em>. In every society they form the majority, and are generally the most
powerful and influential. Laugh not at their laborious disquisitions on the weather, and their
wonderful discoveries of things which every one knows. If you offend a fool, you turn the whole
muddy port of his composition into rancid vinegar, and not all the efforts you can make will
abate its sourness.' One word here to correspondents generally. We have no pleasure in rejecting
a communication, privately or publicly. Often have we sat, with a 'dubious' paper in hand,
hesitating for an hour whether to 'print or burn;' thinking of the fervent wishes of the writer,
and the labor that he had bestowed upon his production. Every part, every period, had perhaps
been considered and re-considered, with unremitting anxiety. He had revised, corrected,
expunged, again produced and again erased, with endless iteration. Points and commas themselves
perhaps had been settled with repeated and jealous solicitude. All this may be, and yet
one's article be indifferent, or unsuited to our pages. Give us credit for candor, gentlemen, as
well as for plain-speaking * * * <span class="smcap">Here</span> are two clever epigrams; the first from a contributor to
whom the reader has heretofore been indebted for several caustic <em>tersities</em> in its kind; the second
from a friend who does not 'confess the cape' of authorship:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">Why</span> is a belle, attired for public gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to a ship? She 'goes about' in stays.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">We can enlighten the ignorance of our Port-Chester friend. Ladies in this meridian eschew
'stays,' as he calls them. They are <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passée</i>, out of date, 'things that were.' 'Hence we view the
gr-e-ät necessity there is' of being <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au fait</i> to the latest fashion. The ensuing purports to have been
written on a '<i>Yankee Belle</i>.' 'Guess <em>not</em>,' though; 'tisn't the way of Yankee belles:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<span class="smcap">She's</span> dressed so neatly for the ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In truth, she's scarcely dressed at all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fact to Yankees quite distressing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It leaves so little room for guessing!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">'Oh! go 'long, you p'ison critter, you! What d'you mean?' * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> should have published
the lines entitled '<i>What is our Life?</i>' but for some <em>forty lines</em>, the thoughts of which are 'conveyed'
entire from <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>. Looking down upon the wilderness of London, the thoughtful <span class="smcap">Teufelsdröckh</span>
exclaims: 'There in that old city was a live ember of culinary fire put down, say only
two thousand years ago; and there, burning more or less triumphantly, with such fuel as the
region yielded, it has burnt, and still burns, and thou thyself seest the very smoke thereof. <i>Ah!
and the far more mysterious live ember of Vital Fire was then also put down there, and still miraculously
burns and spreads.</i>' * * * <span class="smcap">The Drama</span> is once more in the ascendant. The <span class="smcap">Park Theatre</span>, our
'Old Drury,' is a personification of 'The Deformed Transformed.' Externally, it has assumed
the aspect of a fine granite temple, in the Doric style of architecture, with a noble statue of <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>
lording it over the pile; while internally, from pit to ceiling; boxes, walls, proscenium,
stage; <em>every thing</em>, in short, is new and beautiful. Mr. <span class="smcap">Barry</span> deserves the highest praise for the
good taste, the liberality, and the untiring industry which he has brought to bear upon our favorite
place of theatrical resort. The house opened with <span class="smcap">Wallack</span>; <span class="smcap">Wallack</span>, that 'love of a man,'
who can never grow old, and who has lost no whit of his power to delight his auditors. He
opened in his inimitable 'Rolla' and 'Dashall,' to a house crowded from proscenium to dome with
the élite of the metropolis; and he has since gone through his round of characters, including that
most touching of modern plays, '<i>The Rent-Day</i>,' with undiminished popularity. <i>Apropos</i> of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
latter play: a good story is told of its first production in London. The celebrated <span class="smcap">Farren</span>
declined a part in it; remarking, that if the piece ran beyond a single night, he would eat an old
hat for every time it was played. The play rose to immediate and almost unprecedented popularity.
On arriving at the theatre one evening, Mr. <span class="smcap">Farren</span> was informed by the call-boy that
Mr. <span class="smcap">Wallack</span> had left something on a side-table for him, covered with a large white sheet.
'Hum!' grunted <span class="smcap">Farren</span>, 'what is it?' The boy lifted the covering; and behold, ranged in the
most exact order, were thirty-six of the dirtiest, shabbiest, 'shocking bad hats' in London! <span class="smcap">Farren</span>
started, and turned angrily to the lad. 'Please, Sir,' said the boy, 'Mr. <span class="smcap">Wallack</span> says as
how you said, when you refused the part of <i>Crumbs</i> in 'The Rent-Day,' that if the piece ran
beyond a single night, you would eat an old hat; so as it has now been played thirty-seven times,
he thinks it right to give you something to eat, afore the meal becomes too large for your digestion!'
<span class="smcap">Farren</span> said it 'was all right&mdash;and left.' * * * <span class="smcap">Well</span> pleased are we to remark the opening of
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Coudert and Porter</span>'s English and Classical Lyceum, at Number ninety-five Eighth-street,
near Tompkins's-Square. The principals have no superiors; their assistants are of their
careful selection, and have their approval. On <em>these</em> points, therefore, 'enough said.' The situation
is delightful, and the terms consistent with the times. Let these gentlemen be <em>patronized</em>. Ah!
that is not the term; but we have no good synonyme for it. We have always detested the word;
and especially since we encountered Dr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>'s comment upon it, in a letter to Lord <span class="smcap">Chesterfield</span>,
soon after finishing his immortal Dictionary: 'I entertain, Sir, a very strong prejudice
against relying on patrons. Seven years, my Lord, have now passed since I waited in your outward
rooms, or was repulsed from your door; during which time I have been pushing on my
work, through difficulties of which it is useless to complain, and have brought it at last to the
verge of publication, without one act of assistance, one word of encouragement, or one smile of
favor. Such treatment I did not expect, for I never had a patron before.' * * * <span class="smcap">Our</span> friend who
writes us from Florence (his excellent article is filed for our next) is quite right in his ideas of
'<i>Letters of Introduction</i>.' There is much and exaggerated abuse of this courtesy, emanating from
this country. His own case, we can assure him, is by no means a solitary one. We like the
frank reply given by a distinguished American to a young, conceited whipster, who sought,
through the claims of his father's friendship, to obtain letters to persons of distinction abroad: 'I
want,' said he, 'to get letters to <span class="smcap">Scott</span>, to <span class="smcap">Moore</span>, to <span class="smcap">Southey</span>, and to <span class="smcap">Jeffrey</span>. Father would
like to have me see them.' 'So should <em>I</em>,' replied the expected donor, 'but I don't wish <em>them</em> to
see <em>you</em>. If <em>that</em> objection could be removed, perhaps your wish might be gratified.' It 'was stated
at the time' that our young gentleman 'left the presence.' * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> are struck with this
remark of Count <span class="smcap">Rostoptchin</span>, in his sententious memoirs, in preceding pages: 'I had an involuntary
veneration for the sun, and his setting always made me sad.' How often, with kindred
emotion, have we stood and gazed at sunset-clouds, with one who now sleeps in his early grave!
Saying little, but thinking much, and feeling more; and as the day-god sank below the horizon,
reflecting upon the period when all the living world that saw him then, should roll in unconscious
dust around him. Oh! the mystery of nature!&mdash;the mystery of life!... '<i>The Puritans</i> vs. <i>The
Quakers</i>' is <em>at</em> hand and <em>on</em> hand, and <em>will be</em> for some time, we cal'late. Couldn't 'approve' the
sentiments of our Plymouth correspondent, 'any way 'at he can fix it.' We segregate a joke,
however, which is worth pickling. 'Why are the Quakers always well-to-do in the world?' asks
a Friend of one of the 'world's people.' 'They are chargeable to no man, and yet are always
thrifty.' ''Zactly!' was the rejoinder; 'and I'll tell you <em>why</em>. The Quakers <em>are</em> rich, that's sartain;
and the way of it at first was this: When our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> was took up onto the top of an
exceeding high mounting, the <span class="smcap">Old Gentleman</span> offered him all the riches of the world, if he'd fall
down and worship him. 'Twouldn't do: the <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> said 'No;' but a Quaker who was standing
by, took the <span class="smcap">Old Knick</span> up: 'Friend <span class="smcap">Beelzebub</span>,' says he, 'I'll take thy offer!' He did so;
and there's been no scursity of money among your folks sence that time!' * * * '<span class="smcap">Honors</span> are
easy' with sundry of our correspondents. We perceive that, among others, the '<i>Mail-Robber</i>'
was elected a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society of Cambridge University, at the late 'commencement'
of that institution. 'Served him right;' he <em>deserved</em> it. We have 'known things of
him' that would have brought this visitation upon him before, had we chosen to mention them.
'Justice, though slow, always overtakes,' etc. The proverb is something musty. * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> must
be permitted to doubt whether '<em>bally-ragging</em>,' as poor <span class="smcap">Power</span> used to term scolding, is the 'eftest
way' for our New-Haven friend, to whose favor we recently alluded. 'Many men of many
minds.' A spoonful of molasses will catch more flies than a quart of vinegar; and 'an inch of
laugh is worth an ell of moan, in any state of the market.' 'The vices of the times, the vices of
society, the vices of literature, require rigid scrutiny and fearless censors.' Very likely; therefore
'Pay away at them!' say we; but excuse us from monopolizing our pages with gloom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
groutiness, and grumbling. * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> have omitted to notice the superb annual engraving for the
subscribers of the '<cite>Apollo Association</cite>,' recently put forth by that popular institution. The subject
is <span class="smcap">Vanderlyn</span>'s celebrated picture of '<span class="smcap">Caius Marius</span> on the ruins of Carthage.' The engraving
is in line, by <span class="smcap">S. A. Schoff</span>, a native artist, and forms one of the finest specimens of art in its kind
ever produced in this country. * * * Mr. <span class="smcap">Prentice</span>, the well-known Louisville Journalist, is
'down upon' a 'gentleman of some smartness who rejoices in the euphonious name of <span class="smcap">Poe</span>,' (a
correspondent of ours spells it 'Poh!') for terming <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>, in one of his thousand-and-one
<span class="smcap">Mac-Grawler</span> critiques, 'an ass.' The Kentucky poet and politician thus rejoins: 'We have
no more doubt that Mr. <span class="smcap">Edgar A. Poe</span> is a very good judge of an ass, than we have that he is a
very poor judge of such a man as <span class="smcap">Thomas Carlyle</span>. He has no sympathies with the great and
wonderful operations of <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>'s mind, and is therefore unable to appreciate him. A blind
man can describe a rainbow as accurately as Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span> can <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>'s mind. What Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span>
lacks in Carlyleism he makes up in jackassism. It is very likely that Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>'s disciples
are as poor judges of an ass as Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span> is of <span class="smcap">Carlyle</span>. Let them not abuse each other, or strive
to overcome obstacles which are utterly irremovable. That Mr. <span class="smcap">Poe</span> has all the native tendencies
necessary to qualify him to be a judge of asses, he has given repeated evidences to the public.'
'Nervous, but inelegant!' as Mr. <span class="smcap">Aspen</span> remarks in 'The Nervous Man.' * * * <span class="smcap">Can</span> any native
citizen of '<i>The Empire State</i>' peruse the forceful paper under this title, in preceding pages, without
a feeling of natural and just pride? For ourselves, born, bred, and educated upon the soil of
New-York, we cannot read it without a thrill of gratification, that our 'lines have been cast in
pleasant places,' and that we have so 'goodly an heritage.' * * * <span class="smcap">We</span> do not know when we
have been more 'horrified' than on reading the following in a London journal: 'Two natives of
the cannibal islands of Marquesas have been carried to France. The story runs, that on the voyage
one of their fellow-passengers asked them which they liked best, the French or the English?
'The English!' answered the man, smacking his lips; 'they are the <em>fattest</em>.' 'And a great deal
more <em>tender</em>,' chimed in the woman, with a grin that exhibited two rows of pointed teeth as sharp
as a crocodile's!' * * * '<i>The Exile's Song</i>,' with the note which accompanied it, came too late for
insertion in the present number. It will appear in our next. * * * <span class="smcap">The</span> story of '<i>The Tobacco-Quid</i>'
is as old as the seven hills. What a silly thing it is, to give new names and a new <em>locale</em> to
an 'ancient <span class="smcap">Miller</span>,' and at the same time vouch for its entire authenticity and originality! 'O
git eöut!' * * * <span class="smcap">Reader</span>, did you ever see a small puppy bark at an elephant in a menagerie,
whereat the dignified beast didn't even deign to flap his leather-apron ears? Did you ever see a
stump-tailed ape sporting a Roman toga? And have you seen the 'Annihilation of <span class="smcap">Daniel Webster</span>'
by <span class="smcap">Crazy Neal</span>, in a recent newspaper piece of his? Mr. <span class="smcap">Neal</span> thinks the great orator
and statesman a <i>humbug</i>! He is a judge of the article. * * * <span class="smcap">If</span> the '<i>Stanzas to Mary</i>' are a 'little
after the style of <span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>,' we can only say that the <span class="smcap">Wordsworth</span> school is not a
grammar-school:</p>

<p class="noind">is not unlike 'Cats eats mice,' or 'Shads is come!' * * * <span class="smcap">Several</span> communications, among
them 'Chronicles of the Past,' Number Two; 'Evening Hymn;' 'The Deity,' etc., will receive
attention in our next.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomson's Abridgement of Day's Algebra for the use of Schools.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Day</span>'s Algebra
has sustained a high reputation during a period of fourteen years; a fact sufficiently evinced by
the sale of more than forty large editions. In appropriateness of arrangement, perspicuity of
expression, and adaptation to the purposes of instruction, whether public or private, it stands, we
believe, unrivalled. The highest praise which can be bestowed on a school-book is, that 'it is its
own teacher.' By commencing with points so simple that any child of ordinary ability can comprehend
them, and advancing step by step, removing every obstacle when it first presents itself,
and conducting the student gradually into the more intricate parts of the science, the author makes
him master of the subject while he is yet scarcely aware of its difficulties. The exactness of definition
and clearness of illustration which characterize Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomson</span>'s 'Abridgement' together with
the exclusion of the answers to the problems, (a course indispensable to an independent scholar,)
are especially commendable. The method also of completing the square by multiplying the equation
by four times the coëfficient of the higher power of the unknown quantity, and adding to both
members the square of the coëfficient of the lower power, avoids the introduction of fractional
terms, and strikes us as an improvement. The most weighty objection to <span class="smcap">Day</span>'s Algebra has
been its paucity of examples. This defect is remedied in the 'Abridgement,' the number of examples
being nearly twice as great as in the original work.</p>

<h2><a name="LITERARY_RECORD" id="LITERARY_RECORD">LITERARY RECORD.</a></h2>


<p>'<span class="smcap">Prayers for the Use of Families.</span>'&mdash;Here is a volume of some three hundred pages, containing
upward of seventy prayers, designed to meet all conditions of mankind, and all the wants
of humanity. The author, Rev. <span class="smcap">William Jay</span>, of England, has aimed to be very plain and simple
in his diction, since prayer admits of no brilliance, and rejects studied ornament. He has not
substituted finery for elegance, nor the affectation of art for the eloquence of feeling; but has
wisely avoided a strained, inflated style, unintelligible to the ignorant, lamented by the pious, and
contemned by the wise. This is as it should be. It is remarkable that in the Bible no prayer is
recorded, in which the figure employed is not as familiar as the literal expression. An appendix
is added, containing a number of select and original prayers for particular occasions; short
addresses, applicable to certain events and circumstances, and which the reader may insert in
their proper place in the main prayer, or use at the end of it. A work like this, from a competent
pen, may supply with many families an important desideratum. The volume is published by Mr.
<span class="smcap">M. W. Dodd</span>, Brick Church Chapel, opposite the Park.</p>


<p>'<span class="smcap">The Wyandotte, or the Hutted Knoll</span>,' is the title of Mr. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>'s last work, recently
published by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Lea and Blanchard</span>, Philadelphia, in two well-executed volumes in the
pamphlet-form. It embodies legends of the sufferings of isolated families during the troubled
scenes of colonial warfare, which are distinctive in many of their leading facts, if not rigidly true
in the details. We gather from the prefatory remarks of the author, that in these volumes he has
'aimed at sketching several distinct varieties of the human race, as true to the governing impulses
of their educations, habits, modes of thinking, and natures.' How this aim has been accomplished,
we are quite unable to say. We trust however that the friend who transported the work from our
table into the country, will at least repay us for the gratification of which he has deprived us, by
returning it when he is through with it, that we may be ourselves enlightened, and enabled to
enlighten our readers, concerning the character of the work.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Thompson's History of Long-Island.</span>&mdash;A second edition&mdash;revised and greatly enlarged,
and included in two handsome volumes&mdash;has just appeared, of Mr. <span class="smcap">B. F. Thompson</span>'s history of
Long-Island, from its discovery and settlement to the present time. The work embodies many
interesting and important matters, connected with the first settlement of our country and its colonial
and revolutionary history; and includes notices of numerous individuals and families, and a
particular account of different churches and ministers. In short, the indefatigable author has
availed himself of every source of authentic and valuable information which could add to the
interest or usefulness of his work; which we should not omit to mention embraces two large and
well-executed maps, and is illustrated by numerous lithographic engravings of edifices and other
objects of interest on the island; and including the author's 'counterfeit presentment.' Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Gould, Banks and Company</span> are the publishers.</p>


<p>'<span class="smcap">The Karen Apostle.</span>'&mdash;Messrs. <span class="smcap">Gould, Kendall, and Lincoln</span>, Boston, have issued in a
handsome little volume, 'The Karen Apostle, or Memoir of <span class="smcap">Ko-Thah-Byu</span>, the first Karen convert;
with Notices concerning his Nation. By Rev. <span class="smcap">Francis Mason</span>, Missionary to the Karens.'
The first American edition is revised by Prof. <span class="smcap">H. J. Ripley</span>, of Newton (Mass.) Theological
Seminary. The work is 'sent forth in the hope that the interest which has been felt in behalf of
the Karens may be deepened, and that the cause of missions to the heathen in general may be
promoted by the striking proof of the power of the gospel exhibited in its pages.' The work is
illustrated by maps, in part from manuscript, and by one or two well-executed engravings on
wood. The specimens of Karen literature appended to the volume do not afford a very exalted
idea of the writings of that sect; nevertheless, they possess a certain interest in the connection
which they sustain in the volume.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">New Music.</span>&mdash;We have before us, from the extensive and popular establishment of Messrs.
<span class="smcap">James L. Hewitt and Company</span>, Broadway, 'Woodside Waltz,' by Miss <span class="smcap">Marion S. McGregor</span>;
'Grand Austerlitz March and Quickstep, arranged as a Duet, for the Piano-forte,' by
<span class="smcap">George W. Hewitt</span>; 'The Alpine Horn, a Tyrollean,' by <span class="smcap">John H. Hewitt</span>; and 'Robin Buff,

Esq., the music by <span class="smcap">John H. Hewitt</span>, inscribed to Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robert Tyler</span>, and just published by
<span class="smcap">James L. Hewitt and Company</span>, Broadway. If the noble-looking portrait upon the title-page
represents Mrs. <span class="smcap">Tyler</span>, she is justly entitled to the praises with which the journals have teemed,

<p>'<span class="smcap">Alhalla, or the Lord of Taladega: a Tale of the Creek War.</span>'&mdash;Thus is entitled
a narrative poem by <span class="smcap">Henry Rowe Colcraft</span>, better known as <span class="smcap">Henry R. Schoolcraft</span>, Esq.,
an old correspondent of this Magazine. The story turns upon the contests of the Muscogees, their
exertions, their discomfitures, and their final fall. It opens at a distant northern point, within a
short period after the close of the Creek war, and occupies two days and nights in its action. Its
style is a union of the dramatic with the narrative and descriptive; a conjunction well adapted to
the character of the story and the nature of its personages. There are appended to the main poem
a few selected miscellanies, among which we recognize three or four clever effusions, originally
given to the public in these pages. Messrs. <span class="smcap">Wiley and Putnam</span> are the publishers.</p>


<p>'<span class="smcap">The New Purchase.</span>'&mdash;Our task for these departments of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span> was completed,
when we received from Messrs. <span class="smcap">Appleton and Company</span>, a native novel, in two volumes,
entitled 'The New Purchase; or Seven and a half Years in the Far West.' By <span class="smcap">Robert Carlton</span>,
Esq. We have not found leisure to read one of its pages; but if we may judge of its merits
from the encomiums of two or three of our contemporaries of the daily press, it should prove a
work of the most sterling attraction. To say that '<span class="smcap">Mary Clavers</span>' must 'look to her laurels,'
there being an equally gifted laborer in a kindred field, strikes us as very high praise. We hope,
but doubt, to find <em>that</em> precaution in any degree necessary.</p>


<p>'<span class="smcap">Usury: the Evil and the Remedy.</span>'&mdash;The pages of this department of the <span class="smcap">Knickerbocker</span>
were mainly in the hands of the printers, when we received the newspaper folio entitled as above.
We are left but space therefore barely to state, that this essay on usury differs entirely from the
usual mode of treating that subject, in that it does not rely on the <em>penalties</em> for the repression of the
evil, but proposes to root out its existence by a practical, beneficent mode of removing the temptations
to, and occasions for, usury. It is for sale at <span class="smcap">Burgess and Stringer's</span>, corner of Ann-street
and Broadway.'</p>


<p><span class="smcap">New Works from the American Press.</span>&mdash;We have before us several excellent publications,
which came too late for <em>notice</em> in the present number. Among them, we may mention three
entertaining volumes from the press of Messrs. <span class="smcap">Lea and Blanchard</span>, Philadelphia, '<i>The Court
of England</i>,' from 1688 to <span class="smcap">George</span> the <span class="smcap">Third</span>; '<i>Nature and Revelation</i>,' or the Second Advent;
the beautiful '<i>Illustrated Prayer-Book</i>' serials of Mr. <span class="smcap">Hewet</span>; and <span class="smcap">Peabody's</span> <cite>Dartmouth College
Address</cite>. These publications, with others which we lack space even to mention, will be adverted
to in our November number.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> <span class="smcap">This</span> spirited Song is from 'The Adventures of a Poet, a Tale told in Rhyme,' by <span class="smcap">F. W. Thomas</span>, Esq.,
author of 'Clinton Bradshaw,' etc. We have been permitted to peruse the poem in manuscript; and are so
impressed with the life and variety of incident which pervade it, and the ease and grace of its execution, that
we cannot omit the expression of a hope that it may soon be given in a printed form to the public. The self-complacent
tone of the stalwart boatmen of the West, will remind the reader of <span class="smcap">Dibdin's</span> sailor who 'pitied
the poor devils ashore' in a hurricane whose music was so welcome to him on the deep.
